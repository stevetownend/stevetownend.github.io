        <p><strong>Temperature Rising</strong><br>The temperature has been rising over the past week. It was below zero all day when I fish one week ago but has been into double figures this week. Unfortunately there has been more rain so I have been watching the river level prediction like a hawk. At one point it looked like the level would be too high for today but it went down again and was just over a metre up from its normal level. I therefore decided to try Ings Lane Bottom again to see if the Chub were more active today. The forecast was for rain and gusty winds so had to take my brolly and probably have to stay in one peg - no roaming.</p>
<p><strong>Best Made Plans!</strong><br>I got a suprise as I arrived at the lane that goes to the river - it was closed! At this point I might have decided on the Corn Dryers but the strong winds would have been right in my face and not pleasant considering the expected rain. So I decided to go the the Cricket Field stretch.</p>
<p>I walked down to the river and was suprised by how much the bank had changed. There were lots of up-ended treed and bushes around the waterline. It also looked very different from my previous visit due to the fact that all of the Himalayan Balsam was gone leaving large clear areas of mud. Peg 5 looked fishable and had been good for me in the summer. I decided to also have a look further along but then noticed an earth-mover on its way to repair the banks. I decided to wait until it stopped to see where it would be working. They produce a fair amount of vibration so would not want to fish too near them. It stopped around peg 12/13 so looked like peg 5 was the place to be.</p>
<p><strong>Early Indications</strong><br>I fished toward the downstream bush. I had one rod close in with a size 16 hook and a couple of Dendra tips.The other rod was a bit further out and just on the inside of the crease with a size 6 and breadflake. It wasn’t long before I got light twitches on the breadflake. There was nothing hittable but showed there was something in the swim. Could be shy Chub or more likely Roach nipping at the bread. After a few more twitches I decided to try some cheesepaste. Yet again, quick taps but no real bites. After a while things settled down and there we no more twitches.</p>
<p><strong>Lunchtime Lobbies</strong><br>I had been throwing in small balls (smaller than a golf ball) of chopped worm mixed in with soil and liquidised bread. So, around 12:30 I started to use lobworm on the close in rod. I quickly saw very subtle taps on the tip eventually hitting into a nice sized Perch. The shy Perch bites continued throughout most of the afternoon resulting in this nice net of winter fish - the biggest was close to 2lb.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-02-19/12lb10ozPerchBag.jpg" alt="12lb 10oz Perch Bag"></p>
<p>I decided to alternate between breadflake and luncheon meat on the further out rod. This was in the hope of a Chub turning up. I did get a few taps on meat but nothing I could strike at.</p>

        <p><strong>Cold Winter Day</strong><br>It has been very cold for the past few days. It was -7 yesterday morning and -5 when I awoke this morning. I am glad that we have a local river as all of the ponds and canals are frozen solid.</p>
<p>As I headed out today I knew that there was only one species that might take a bait today - the wily old Chub! So I went armed with Dendrobaena, Lobworms, Cheesepaste, Bread and Luncheon Meat. I arrived about 9:45am.</p>
<p>I had only been using one rod with a roving approach on my recent trips but none of these resulted in a fish. So, I decided to take 2 rods to increase my chances. I had also been using a size 6 hook on these trips so decided to take some rigs made up with size 14 and 16 in case the 6s were too heavy and putting off shy biting fish. I fished peg 7 at Ings Lane Bottom. There are bushes to my left and right so I fished one rod to each bush. </p>
<p>I fished a size 16 with lobworm tail to my right and a size 6 with breadflake to my left. Within the first 90 minutes I got a few taps on breadflake but none were hittable. They could have been line bites or fish just nipping off bits of bread - either way it showed that were fish in the swim. I also got a tap on worm of the right hand rod but again, not hittable. At least my confidence was now quite high.</p>
<p>I then decided to try a smaller piece of breadflake on the size 16 to my right hand side. The hook wasn’t really big enough for the bread but I thought it was worth a try. At about 12:10, after the bread had been in for about 10 minutes, I got a proper bite and hit into a nice hard fighting Chub. I had to apply lots of side strain to stop it reaching the bush. It was great to see a decent sized fish as I brought it up to the surface. The end result was this lovely 4lb 2oz Chub. It felt quite hollow so could be much heavier if it filled out a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-02-12/4lb2ozChub.jpg" alt="4lb 2oz Chub"></p>
<p>This really got my hopes up. However, no matter what I tried I could not get another bite.</p>
<p>I decided to take out my keepnet with about 30 minutes to go. This would give it a chance to drip-dry. However it froze solid! It’s the first time I have had to collapse a frozen net (like a large spring). Also, when taking off my hook length, my pear-shaped lead had been on the ground for no more than 2 minutes - when I lifted my rod, the lead had frozen to the ground. It really was a chilly day.</p>

        <p><strong>Chilly Day</strong><br>It was supposed to stay dry until lunchtime but the snow started about 9:30am and persisted on and off most of the day. </p>
<p>I was hoping for some Chub but tried lobworm, cheese paste and breadflake all to no avail.</p>
<p>Early afternoon I got one bite from this nice Perch on lobworm.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-01-02/2lb10ozPerch.jpg" alt="2lb 10oz Perch"></p>
<p>Nothing else happened and I decided to pack up before it got dark. However I lost my footing and slipped in the mud and, whilst trying to regain my grip, noticed that my tip shot around but, by the time I got to it, the fish had reached cover and snagged me up. I suspect it was a Chub and just typical that it waited (as they so often do) until I was pre-occupied!</p>

        <p><strong>Great Expectation</strong><br>Having had a couple of nice Bream from peg 25, I decided on a pre-baiting session to see if I could get a shoal of Bream feeding. Therefore I went out at 7:30am and lunchtime for each day from Mon to Thu, intending to fish it on Friday. I really had no idea how much to feed at this time of year. I decided on 5 or 6 orange-sized balls, twice per day.</p>
<p>As I expected, someone did fish the peg on one of the days (Tue). He had a 10lb Barbel in his keepnet and hooked into what we suspect was a large Bream whilst I was there.</p>
<p>So, finally, Friday arrived. However, so did the 1st real frosts of the year. It was a lomg, cold day where I was receiving lots of single taps on the tip (nothing to strike at). When I had nothing by lunchtime I was doubting that there were any Bream about.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, just before the sun went down, I managed a nice Perch. But no Bream whatsoever.</p>

        <p><strong>Patience Required</strong><br>I fished the middle lane at Ellenthorpe in the deeps (peg 25). It was a full day session with not much activity. However, the lobworm turned up trumps when I hooked into a very fit 5lb river Bream at 1pm.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-11-20/5lbBream.jpg" alt="5lb Bream"></p>
<p>Then around 2:40pm, I hooked into a hard fiting Barbel that was a real surprise. I wasn’t expecting Barbel in late November.</p>

        <p><strong>Another Exploratory Bream Session</strong><br>I fished the far lane at Ellenthorpe in the hope of locating a Bream shoal. I fished 2 rods with groundbait feeder on both rods. I fished lob worm on one rod and trout pellet on the other. I was surpised at how relatively shallow the water was in this area - much shallower that the mioddle lane stretch.</p>
<p>I fished all day for a single bite and was surprised that this 4.5lb Chub fell to lobworm when I was expecting Bream.</p>

        <p><strong>River up again</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 10.9m and falling slightly.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bbc.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offite Link</a></p>
<p>Arrived around lunchtime for an afternoon session through to dusk. Fished peg 25 again. Having got a new 17ft float road, I was really hoping for a float session today but the high river level put paid to that idea.</p>
<p>So, it was the usual 2 rods. One out in front of me, about 3/4 of the way across on halibut pellet with PVA mesh bags and one downstream on the same bait.</p>
<p><strong>First signs</strong><br>After about 30 minutes I started getting good strong taps on the downstream rod. However these did not turn into hittable bites. So, after 40 minutes I switched the downstream rod to luncheon meat in case Chub had been tapping the pellet but not taking it.</p>
<p><strong>Bream, a first!</strong><br>About 50 minutes into the session I got a bite on pellet and hit into a solid fish. As I brought it in I expected that it was a Barbel that had yet to wake up so was expecting a lunge at any time. Imagine my surprise when it broke the surface and was a lovely river Bream. This is my first on the Ure and my 1st on halibut pellet: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-09/5lb8ozBream.jpg" alt="5lb 8oz Bream"></p>
<p><strong>No action on meat</strong><br>I did not get any interest in the meat so decided to switch to lobworm, this could pick up Barbel, Chub, big Perch or the Bream that were obviously now in the swim. I got a bite within 5 minutes and hit into a decent sized Eel. Thankfully I lip hooked it so was able to unhook it and return it. So, an Eel, that’s another first on the Ure.</p>
<p><strong>Barbel lost</strong><br>About 3 hours into the session I got a Barbel bite that nearly took my rod. I just managed to grab it. This was a typical Barbel fight and I thought that I was going to net it. However, when it got close, it lunged down to a sunken tree to my right. I tried to stop it but my line snapped. I am glad there was no-one around to hear my swearing!</p>
<p><strong>Another Eel</strong><br>After a couple more hours, my lobworm rod went again and it was another Eel. Slightly smaller and lip hooked again. I then decided to go back onto halibut pellet on the downstream rod as I didn’t really want any more Eels.</p>
<p><strong>Twilight Barbel</strong><br>The light was failing fast and I was about 15 minutes away from leaving when I got persistent small taps on my downstream pellet. I waited to see if it would develop into a proper pull around suspecting that a Bream was mouthing the pellet. However it continued to tap so I had to hit it and was surprised that it was a Barbel. It was solid and heavy like a Barbel but didn’t strip line off. As I got it close I was prepared for the lunge but none came so I netted the fish first time: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-09/8lbBarbel.jpg" alt="8lb Barbel"></p>
<p>This fish took a long time to recover in the landing net and I released it after a few minutes. Then it rose to surface again and was struggling. I was able to net it and spent several more minutes holding it to let water flow through it’s gills. It seemed to want to go so I released it and, yet again, it popped up to the surface. So I netted it again and found an area near the end of my peg where I could stand in 8-10 inches of water and cradle the fish to help it right itself. After a while I noticed that it was blowing bubbles out of its mouth and it’s gill covers. That’s obviously what had been causing it distress. I also noticed that the skin around where its dorsal fin met it’s body seemed very pale as if the fish was ill. This is perhaps why it hand’t fought the way I expected. Eventually I was able to release the fish and it seemed to swim away fine.</p>

        <p><strong>Tue 6th, River falling fast</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 10.5m and falling.</em></strong></p>
<p>The river was falling fast since its very high level on Sunday. I have heard that the Ure fishes better when falling rather than the norm which is to fish better when rising (for Barbel). I was therefore keen to head out again to peg 25 for a couple of hours after work.</p>
<p>I decided to fish both rods on the halibut pellet and PVA mesh bags. One almost straight out in front and one downstream, both between 3/4 across and the far side. </p>
<p><strong>Quick fish - lost!</strong>‘<br>I got a bite on my downstream rod after about 25 minutes (around 5pm) and hit into a Barbel that seemed relatively calm. That is, until it got near to the surface. It then lunged down and I could not stop it’s run into the depths just in front of me. After a few seconds my line snapped. Upon inspection, about 5 - 6m of line had suffered major abrasion. I suspect the Barbel took me through an underwater bush/tree before snapping me. So, I discarded that line and set up again. </p>
<p><strong>Missed bite</strong><br>Around 5:30pm it started to rain so I began to put up my brolly. The Barbel must have been watching as that was a stimulus for my downstream rod to go again. I managed to get to it and struck, fully expecting to connect with the fish but there was nothing there - arghhh!</p>
<p><strong>Tap tap tap</strong><br>From about 6:15pm until dark (7pm), I was getting taps and little pulls on both rods. These tended to happen after I twitched the bait a bit. None of these turned into hittable bites. Whilst I had not banked any fish tonight, I really enjoyed it because the Barbel were around and I felt that I had found another good stretch after my very unproductive September.</p>
<p>I have also ordered a 17ft float rod so that I can have a few float sessions and hopefully get some nice Roach, Chub, Perch and maybe Bream. It is very deep at Ellenthorpe so the long rod should really help.</p>
<p><strong>Wed 7th, River almost normal</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 9.8m and falling slightly.</em></strong></p>
<p>I was still full of expectation from my previous evening so could not resist another couple of hours in peg 25. When I got there I could see signs of someone else having been in the peg but then noticed that the overhanging bush/tree had been cut back a bit. So I was not sure if it was a fisherman or a working party preparing for Sunday’s match. I decided to fish peg 25 anyway.</p>
<p>Despite my heightened expectations I did not get any signs of fish until about 6pm. I then got little taps on both rods but no firm bites. Again, this was after twitching the bait a bit.</p>
<p>I decided to pack up at 7pm (a few mins earlier than my previous visits). However, at 6:55pm my upstream rod bent over and I hit into a very hard fighting Barbel. After a good scrap I landed this lovely 9lb 10oz fish: - </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-07/9lb10ozBarbel.jpg" alt="9lb 10oz Barbel"></p>
<p>It is interesting that this fish also has a nick in the top of it’s tail fin. I have now had 3 fish with similar nicks (2 of them were similar weights so could have been the same fish).</p>

        <p><strong>Trying a new peg</strong><br>I arrived just after mid-day, planning to fish until dusk. I decided on peg 25 at Ellenthorpe - middle stretch. Other than the fact that there seem to be Barbel around here, another plus is that it is a very short walk from the car which is parked just the other side of the flood bank. This means that I can take lots of stuff with me just in case e.g. brolly, extra feeders, leads etc and even an extra rod in case I want to give the float a go. These can all stay in the car until needed.</p>
<p>Peg 25 was a very comfortable peg. It had a nice flat area to each side of my chair and a small promontary just in front of my chair which gave plenty of room to stand, play fish etc. Caution is advised though - the water is about 10 feet deep right at the water’s edge!</p>
<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong><br>I decided to fish the Barbel rod straight out in front of me, about 3/4 across the river (with halibut pellet and PVA mesh bag) and my Chub rod further downstream and roughly mid-river. On this rod I would start with lobworm in the hope of either Barbel, Chub, Perch or Bream and then alternate with luncheon meat that I was also trying in PVA mesh for the 1st time.</p>
<p><strong>Pellet is king</strong><br>My first bite came about 3:40pm on the Barbel rod with halibut pellet. I was actually just changing bait on the Chub rod when I saw the Barbel bite. This was fortunate as I did not need to worry about getting snagged up in the second rod/line.</p>
<p>The Barbel, as usual, fought really well. However, the deep water close in seemed to spur the fish onto continual lunges into the depths whenever I thought I was about to net it. I was just hoping there were no bad snags down there. Thankfully it seemed clear enough and I eventually netted this lovely 9lb fish: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/9lbBarbel.jpg" alt="9lb Barbel"></p>
<p>I decided to use a keepnet for the Barbel. This is not something that I would normally do but I have seen many club members using a net and the fish seem non the worse for wear. This would allow me to photograph several fish together if I was ever lucky enough to catch more than one - I haven’t so far on the Ure.</p>
<p>Having got a fish mid afternoon I was hopeful of getting at least one more before the session ended. However it was a very long and uneventful afternoon and evening. I did not get a single knock on the Chub rod and only that one bite on the Barbel rod. I did notice that the halibut pellets fell off the hair a couple of times before I even cast in - I need to find a solution to that otherwise I will be sat there for ages with no bait on the hook!</p>
<p><strong>Late appearance</strong><br>I decided to pack up and had just pulled up my keepnet (Barbel not yet released) when my Barbel rod crashed into the water in front of me. I initially thought I may have hit the rod rest and knocked it off but then saw the tip bending around and heading downstream. I quickly released the netted Barbel and was easily able to grab the rod and had a relatively calm fight (in Barbel terms) with this 7lb 4oz fish: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/7lb4ozBarbel.jpg" alt="7lb 4oz Barbel"></p>
<p>This one had a noticeable nick in the bottom of it’s tail fin.</p>
<p><strong>A new first</strong><br>This is the first time that I have managed more than 1 Barbel in a session on the Ure. I wasn’t able to get a photo of both together due to the unfashionably late arrival of the second fish. Maybe next time I will go all out and use halibut pellet on both rods so see if I can beat 2 in a session.</p>
<p><strong>Two days later, up again</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 13.4m and peaking.</em></strong></p>
<p>After a lousy Saturday where we all experienced a lot of rain, the river was rising most of the day on Sunday. It looked to be peaking around 4pm so decided to try a couple of hours until dusk. Whilst I was expecting it to be up by 3 metres from Friday, I didn’t really appreciate what that meant having not fished this stretch very much. When I got there the river was well over it’s normal banks and working it’s way up the flood bank. The following photo shows just how high it was - I would normally be fishing in that line of trees that are 10m out in the river!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/Flood.jpg" alt="Flood"></p>
<p>I was only able to fish one rod due to the strong flow and did not get any bites despite trying halibut pellet, luncheon meat and lobworm. I did manage to loose one lead but it was a lovely evening once I got sat under the brolly for the occasional shower that showed up. The river looked lovely as the sun was dipping down over the trees: -</p>
