        <p><strong>A first for me</strong><br>I have never float fished in fast shallow water so was really looking forward to today. Unfortunately it started to rain the night before and the forecast was for rain on and off all day with moderate wind and only 12 degrees. I considered taking some warmer clothes but decided that my fleece and waterproof (thin) jacket would suffice. It was raining when I awoke and all the way to the river. It was quite a challenge getting my seatbox to the river due to a small twisting path that had a steep drop off right next to it. I was hoping to fish in the same peg where I had seen someone fishing on YouTube last season but a tree had unfortunately come down and completely blocked that peg. I got as close as I could to that area but the water looked quite shallow.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-river seatbox again</strong><br>It took a while but I was able to setup mid-river as I had on the Ure. However this water was much faster. I got everything to hand and had my brolly ready. It was only light drizzle so didn’t need it yet. As I suspected, it was very shallow, I struggled to get 18”. I used a chubber/loafer float and 6lb line. The float moved between the green of reflected trees and the white/gray sky reflection making it hard to choose the right tip colour. I started with my trusty yellow; whilst great in the trees it was not much use against the sky. I then tried a red tip but was useless against the trees. I ended up using a black marker to cover most of the tip and used tippex to create a white dome at the top of the tip. This worked and allowed me to see the float as it moved down river.</p>
<p>As I was about to start fishing, another angler arrived. He fished above me (just below the island) and trotted to just before my peg.</p>
<p><strong>First fish</strong><br>I got my first Chub on about the 10th trot down. The bite came at the very end of the swim. I wasn’t actually sure it was a bite but firm resistance from a small Chub (about 1.5 lb) got me excited.</p>
<p>I then noticed that the other angler had a fish. It was a small Barbel of about 2lb. </p>
<p><strong>Another Chub</strong><br>It took a long time to get the next fish and it also came at the far end of my swim. It was a little bigger than the first and was a definite bite. Shortly afterward I hooked (then lost) another. It appeared that my quick-link was open and the hooklength simply came away. Surely I had remembered to close it.</p>
<p>The other angler ended up with three small Barbel. I went to see him (he was from Selby) and noticed that he had much more depth than me. Obviously there was a hollow as the channels from both sides of the island converged. This was worth remembering for future visits. We also discussed rolling some meat to see if that would result in a bigger Chub.</p>
<p><strong>Meat rolling</strong><br>This is another technique that I have never really used (never been in fast enough water). I used a link ledger of 3 or 4 AAA, cast to the far side bushes then slowly eased the tip along with the flow, occasionally lifting the rod tip or paying out more line to dislodge the meat so that it would trundle along. The bites were great - little tugs and rattles on the tip. I got another 2 similar sized Chub on the method before bites dried up.</p>
<p>By now it was raining consistently and my brolly was up. I was getting very cold and uncomfortable even though I had on both the fleece and waterproof jacket.</p>
<p><strong>Another attempt on the float</strong><br>As bites had dried up on the meat I tried again on the float. I tried my previous trot and also across to a bay in the farside trees. I did not get any more bites and was starting to strain my back.</p>
<p><strong>Bomb and meat</strong><br>I decided to give the bomb a try and lift my riod tip high. Even though the water was fast, it was very shallow so I could hold bottom with a 1.5oz lead. This would allow me to rest my back and put my hands under my arm pits to warm them. In future I will keep my winter coat in the car just in case. I managed a futher 2 similar sized Chub before deciding to go home, get warm and have a nap.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Opening day - a scorcher!</strong><br>We had a very hot week prior to the season starting. This continued into opening day. Opening day was my first chance to test out my seatbox, loading it and pushing it to the peg. Then getting it down the river bank to the riverside. </p>
<p><strong>3 days - 3 pegs</strong><br>I had taken a couple of days off work so that I could fish 3 consecutive days prior to our first match. </p>
<p>For opening day I chose peg 6 as there was a nice downstream bush that has a deep hole in front of it. It was a very hot day and I ended up using my brolly to shade me from the sun. I started to fish mid-river with Scopex boilies and PVA bags whilst feeding near the bush with hemp/caster, with occasional bread, luncheon meat and cheese paste. Whilst I waited for fish to start feeding at the downstream bush, I tried the waggler across the river on caster and feeding hemp and caster with my catapult. I had a few small Chublets and a Dace or two. I then tried near the bush on bread and it wasn’t long before I got a good bite. I struck into what I suspected was a Chub but once I applied pressure, my 8lb hook link snapped. I suspect a Chub took my bread then a Pike grabbed the Chub and cut my line. I had no interest mid-river and no further interest near the bush until much later in the day when my tip started to move steadily. I eventually struck but ended up netting a Pike that was hooked in the outside of it’s head - I suspect it had been giving line bites.</p>
<p>For the next day I decided to try one of the pegs where you can wade out. I had bought some waders that are boot-less (they have a waterproof neoprene sock) and a pair of wading boots. I was able to take my seatbox into mid-river and setup very comfortably so that I could fish the stick float near the far bank bushes. I was able to keep everything (including a bag containing extra clothes, pack-up etc) with me so that I had everything to hand. I had to use the brolly to shade from the sun again. This was lovely fishing, being so close to the water. unfortunately my reel line (Preston float-fishing line) did not float so made line control and striking very difficult resulting in many missed bites from the fast-biting Dace. I ended up with a few Dace and Chublets. I also tried bigger baits and ledgered meat and bread but got no interest.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-23/MidRiver.jpg" alt="Mid-river setup"></p>
<p>For my final practice day I tried peg 1 as was closest to the road bridge where all of the Chub and Barbel were still shoaled up. I got a few more Chublets, some a bit bigger but no interest from anything else. The best part of this day was that I tried Mucilin on my line so that it floated and made line control and striking much-much better.</p>
<p><strong>No big stuff</strong><br>So, my practice days showed that there were no big fish showing. I should therefore focus on hemp/caster for the Dace and Chublets with a chance that a bigger Chub may appear.</p>
<p><strong>First match</strong><br>I drew peg 16 which was the furthest peg, directly opposite the nab-end of Milby Island. The river was narrower here and I was told that Barbel often show up under the bush to my right. When I checked the depth under the bush it was only inches deep. I went a little further out and it was a little deeper. I decided to feed that area but leave it alone while I used hemp/caster in the feeder with caster on the hook near the far bank. I got a Roach on the first cast. On the second cast I had a longer wait and then got a bite that suggested another Roach or Chublet. However it immediately took off and peeled line off the reel. I was frantically trying to remember what strength hooklink I had on. It was only 3lb so I had no chance with the Barbel that was tearing off down-river. It wasn’t long before my line broke. The rest of the match was pretty uneventful and I ended up with 1lb 5oz of Roach and Chublets.</p>
<p>No-one else had any big fish except peg 1 where one decent Chub was caught for a weight of near 6lb in total. This was also the golden peg so resulted in a £100 win.</p>
<p><strong>Swale Investigation</strong><br>I purchased a Leeds DASA membership this year as they have a few stretches on the Swale and Aire and Calder Canal. I have seen a video of someone fishing at Asenby on the Swale in very shallow and very fast water. He used a chubber/loafer float and was catching Chub and nice Dace on maggot and caster. I really fancied that. So, on the day after the match I had a drive to Asenby (only 10 minutes from home) and checked out the venue for suitability of seatbox. I really fancy fishing on my seatbox in the shallows. So, I decided that I will try this on Friday.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-23/Asenby.jpg" alt="Fast, shallow stretch at Asenby"></p>
<p><strong>Big fish showing on the Ure</strong><br>Tue 22nd was a day to try the Ure (Cricket Field) again for an evening session. I had become a little worried about the effort of taking a fully loaded seatbox to the river especially when drawing the furthest peg. So, I decided to reconfigure the box so that I was taking much less. This made a huge difference and it was easy to get to the river and much quicker to setup and packup. I fished peg 5 as there was a downstream bush that had given me several good fish last year. I arrived about 6pm and immediately baited under the bush whilst I got setup. I decided to fish one rod mid-river with Halibut pellet and the other rod near the bush rotating between bread, cheesepaste and luncheon meat. </p>
<p>I got no interest mid-river by 8pm so decided to fish luncheon meat on that rod at the bush but further from the bank than my other rod. At 8:30 I was fishing meat on both rods. I turned to get some bread ready for my nearest rod and when I turned around the rod was bent over. I lifted into a Barbel that took off under the bush and eventually snapped me. About 15 minutes later I got another really good bite on the same rod on meat but missed it - Chub I guess.</p>
<p>Next, I got a bite on meat on the furthest rod and hit into a Barbel. This was my smallest in the Ure to date at 5lb 8oz. Throughout the last hour I had several plucks on meat on the furthest rod. Some of them developed into proper bites that I missed when I struck. I suspect these were Chub as the meat was on a hair rig. In future I will dispense with the hair rig once I start fishing close-in.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>So, it took me two weeks to catch my 1st fish in the river last year. This year I have been catching smaller fish from day one and have located bigger fish in the first week so looks good for the new season.</p>

        <p><strong>A very cold spring</strong><br>What a strange spring, we had very little rain, freezing nights - even into May and the occasional sunny day. However the cold nights did nothing to raise the water temperature of the pond. This meant that the fish were very docile and not ready to spawn. Even the bankside vegetation and lillies were held back.</p>
<p><strong>Pleasure Sessions</strong><br>The cold temperatures resulted in having the best fishing in the very deep pegs (11, 12 etc). As the water slowly started to warm and the warmer days arrived (still freezing nights), I decided to try the mid-depth pegs (25 - 27). I had some successful sessions there with lots of bubbling Bream, some caught on the waggler. I also tried a day of fishing two feeders, one on a method feeder with pellet as bait and the other on a cage feeder with normal groundbait and natural baits (caster, sweetcorn, worm). On this occasion, the natural baits were definitely better. I retried the same experiment a few weeks later (when it had warmed more), this time the pellet feeder was the better choice with soaked 2mm pellets in a cage feeder and trout/coarse pellets on the hook.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-15/MixedNet.jpg" alt="Mixed Net including nice Tench"></p>
<p>In peg 26 I also managed to get the Ide feeding near the surface in the warmer afternoons (still cold nights). I had a good bag fishing shallow and even managed a couple of skimmers near the surface.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-15/ShallowNet.jpg" alt="Shallow catch"></p>
<p>Once the weather properly warmed up and the nights warmed too - the pond exploded with life. Lillies seemed to be popping up before my eyes and I could watch Carp cruising in the margins and at the surface further out. On one occasion I tried a pellet shallow but got a 5lb Bream rather than the Carp that I expected.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the warmer weather co-incided with a lot of willow fluff on on the pond making several pegs unfishable. </p>
<p><strong>Carp Sessions</strong><br>I decided to try peg 15 which had done really well in threee consecutive matches with large catches (40 - 50lb of small Mirror Carp). By now the lillies were up and this peg was completely surrounded by sunken bushes and lillies. I kept firing pellets to the edge of the lillies and it wasn’t long before they started moving as Carp turned up. I used my Carp rod and 10lb line so that I could bully them through the lillies. I ended up with a few nice fish for over 30lb. This practice was to come in handy in the last match (see below).</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Peg15.jpg" alt="Peg 15 - Surrounded"></p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-15/11lb8ozCommonCarp.jpg" alt="11lb 8oz Common Carp"><br><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Mirror1.jpg" alt="Peg 15 - Mirror Carp"><br><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Mirror2.jpg" alt="Peg 15 - Mirror Carp"><br><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Mirror3.jpg" alt="Peg 15 - Mirror Carp"><br><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Mirror4.jpg" alt="Peg 15 - Mirror Carp"></p>
<p><strong>Matches</strong><br>As previously posted, I was 2nd in the 1st match of the season. I then drew peg 6 twice in succession which is apparently very good in summer but wasn’t much good in our dire spring. I then drew peg 19 which is where I had success with the pellet feeder in a practice session. This is also a fancied Bream peg. However, it failed to produce on the day. For the last match I drew peg 16 which was next to peg 15 where I had practiced. This was also very shallow and surrounded by lillies. I used the same tactic of heavy gear and pellets, sight fishing to moving lillies and managed 3 Carp for 13lb and 2nd place. I lost 2 more, either of which would have won me the match.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-06-15/Peg16.jpg" alt="Peg 16 - I fancied this one"></p>
<p><strong>New Seatbox</strong><br>I have never owned a seatbox. When pleasure fishing this isn’t much of a problem because you can choose a peg where you can get your chair and bankstick in and you know where you are going and what you are targetting so can just take the gear that you need. However, match fishing changes all that - you might get drawn in a peg with a concrete base (not good for banksticks) or on a smallish peg or very sloped bank (not good for a chair that has splayed legs).</p>
<p>I had done a fair bit of research into the different seat boxes and wanted one that was flexible enough for both pond and river work and had wheels good enough for rough river banks. I had also watched what several anglers used on YouTube and seen their reviews.</p>
<p>I finally chose the Octbox - a very versatile and sturdy system. Unfortunely it was out of stock and there was a waiting list of several months. I put in my order and then waited. It finally arrived just before the last pond match giving me time to have a practice session first.</p>

        <p><strong>Preparation</strong><br>We had some lovely warm weather about 12 days before the match. However that only lasted two days and then we returned to near arctic conditions with nights below zero and snow showers that could popup at any time. This cold snap lasted all the way to the match day so it didn’t look good for the pond.</p>
<p>I decided to get some practice so fished it a week before the match. I chose the deeper swims (peg 12) where I had the stockie carp previously. The day started ok with quite a few bites that resulted in a few Ide and Roach but dried up after the first hour and a half. I put in some feed and groundbait and gave the page a break for 30 minutes or so. Upon my return I had a Bream of 6lb. I then had a solitary small Mirror Carp (another of those stocked last year). Later I had another Bream, this time 5lb 8oz on the feeder (sweetcorn and worm). I finished the day with one more Bream of about 4lb 8oz.</p>

<p><strong>Second practice</strong><br>Two days before the match I decided to try one of the pegs that I have not fished before (peg 26). It was a very cold start to the day and I struggled to get a bite for the first hour and a half. Then I managed a few Ide and Roach and also got one of the small Tench that was stocked last year. At 3:40, twenty minutes before the planned match end, I got a lovely Bream of about 6lb giving me a total net of 10lb. I would be happy with that in the match!</p>
<p><strong>Match Day</strong><br>I awoke to frost on the grass and an iced up car - not a good start. I just hoped to draw one of the deeper pegs. I had broken my chair a couple of weeks ago but had a idea of how to patch it up until my new seatbox arrives (more of that later).</p>
<p>I was very happy to draw peg 11 in the deeper part of the pond. I started to get bites from the off and managed a few small Ide and Roach. I also got another two of the small Mirror Carp and pulled out of a skimmer. The guys either side of me seemed to be catching similar amounts.</p>
<p>Then at lunchtime, it went dead. I tried corn and worm on the feeder for an hour and got nothing. I then had a very barren afternoon with just a few shy half-bites but no fish. When it got to 15 minutes before the end of the match I thought that the chances of a Bream had gone.</p>
<p><strong>Late breaking news….</strong><br>Then, with ten minutes to go I hit into a nice Bream. My heart was in my mouth just hoping that I would not pull out of it as I had a skimmer earlier in the day. Thankfully I got it in and could not wait for the weigh-in.</p>
<p><strong>Result</strong><br>I ended up finishing second. Not bad for my first match in 25 years. You could call it luck but I have managed at least one big Bream on every visit to the pond this year when others have not. </p>

        <p><strong>A new peg for me</strong><br>I had planned to fish peg 19 as the wind was forecast to be coming from behind that pag. However, when I arrived the committee of Gary, Gary and Kevin were already there and fishing the pegs I had planned to try. However both Garys recommended peg 12 (which should also have the wind behind it).</p>
<p><strong>Waggler at close-medium range</strong><br>Last year I had a clear out and got rid of my old floats (some were probably 30 years old). I have just ordered some new ones so didn’t have any heavy wagglers with me. I therefore fished about 20m out. </p>
<p><strong>A slow start</strong><br>I fished the float for a couple of hours whilst also feeding a swim just off the island for the feeder/bomb later. I only managed a couple of small Roach and a skimmer by 11am so decided to rest the float line and try the feeder for an hour or so. I had a couple of twitches on sweetcorn but no real bites. The maggot didn’t work on the feeder either.</p>
<p><strong>That’s more like it</strong><br>When I went back on the waggler I immediately started getting bites. They were very shy, not managing to pull the float entirely under but started to catch small Mirror Carp that were stocked last year. I managed 4 of these stockies by lunchtime. I then put in some feed and went to see the guys whilst I had my own food.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoyable afternoon</strong><br>When I got back I continued to get those shy bites that resulted in more stockies. I also hooked a bigger Carp and almost had it in when it headed for the tree at my left hand side - I applied side-strain to turn the fish but my hook pulled out my hook ended in the tree to my right. So, I tackled up again and managed a couple more stockies before getting a 6lb Bream - no sign of spawning nodules yet. </p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-03-19/6lb0ozBream.jpg" alt="6lb Bream"></p>
<p>I continued to get bites on and off all afternoon and ended up with 2 skimmers, 2 Roach, that 6lb Bream and 12 of those little stockie Mirrors.</p>

        <p><strong>Today (Mon) was lovely, Fri was not!</strong><br>I had hopped for a couple of trips to the river before the end of the season but last weeks rainfall knocked that on the head. river was 3-4M over depth.</p>
<p>So, despite a terrible forecast for Friday I decided on the Lake and chose a peg where the wind would be from behind me. The plan being to shelter from the rain under my brolly. The wind really picked up and was gusting from all directions so I had to take my brolly down and just put up with the rain and sever wind chill. </p>
<p>The fish were not interested. I managed to very small (hand-sized) Ide and a Bream of about 2lb.</p>
<p><strong>Monday, let’s try again</strong><br>There had been quite good reports from the pond over the past couple of weeks so I wondered what I had done wrong on Friday. Then, last night, I noticed a posting on Facebook that said that everyone had struggled on the Lake at the weekend due to the cool wind and rain - phew, it’s not just me!</p>
<p>So, I didn’t have great expectations today but the weather forecast was nice so I should at least have a pleasant day.</p>
<p><strong>Sun glare forced me to the feeder</strong><br>I had intended to float fish most of the day. However, the early sun was right in my face and made it very hard to see the float. I therefore decided to use the feeder until the sun moved around a bit. I did hit into a Bream on the feeder and got it half way in before I pulled out.</p>
<p><strong>Now it’s float time</strong><br>Nothing else showed on the feeder. However I had continued to feed my float line so was looking forward to fishing it once the sun had moved. I wasn’t long before I started getting little pulls and rises on the float. eventually I got two fish in two casts, the first being a Roach and the next being a skimmer. Not much happened for the next couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>Shallow up a bit</strong><br>I decided to try off bottom for a while. This immediately resulted in several really small Roach and Ide. However, nothing bigger showed.</p>
<p><strong>Back on the bottom</strong><br>I went back on the bottom and managed a few bigger Roach and Ide. Then I hit into a lovely solid Bream. This was great on the light float gear and ended up being the following 5lb 8oz Bream. I really loved those gold coloured cheeks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-03-15/5lb8ozBream.jpg" alt="5lb 8oz Bream"></p>
<p>I tried the feeder several times on and off during the day but got nothing other than a few little knocks.</p>

        <p><em>Level 9.8m</em><br><strong>Two day roving</strong><br>Weather had been reasonable for the past few days with no real rain. Therefore the level was normal and water clarity was good. I decided to go roaming on Ings Lane Bottom on Thu 4th. I fed 3 pegs with a mixture of liquidised bread, chopped worm and bread mash. I then fished them in turn, feeding another 2 pegs once I started in the last of the 3 pegs that I had already fed. I fished each for about 30 minutes, 10 on breadflake, 10 on cheesepaste and 10 on lobworm.</p>
<p><strong>Thu - Ings Lane Bottom</strong><br>I started in peg 5 and worked my way downstream. There was some unexpected rain today and it was breezy from time to time. At least the breeze dried out the effects of the rain. I had no indications until my 5th peg - just near the hawthorne bush. By the time I got there it was around 3pm. I had a few plucks on lobworm and then eventually got a hittable bite that resulted in a Perch of 2lb. No sooner had I returned it then I got another of 1lb 10oz. I decided to stay in that peg because I was getting lots of little plucks but didn’t manage to hit any other bites.</p>
<p><strong>Fri - Cricket Field</strong><br>I repeated the roving technique of yesterday with the same feeding pattern and 30 minutes per swim. I started in peg 2. The weather was much nicer today - no breeze and no need for gloves. However there were a lots of dogs about and I was just about to move to peg 3 when a dog launched itself in to the river at peg 3. So, I gave peg 2 an extra 10 minutes to give peg 3 a chance to settle. I had no bites in peg 2. I went to peg 3 and stared with bread, then tried cheesepaste. Finally the lobworm produced a bite that resulted in my personalm best Perch of 2lb 14oz - so close to my 3lb target. I ended up with 3 Perch from peg 3 before the bites slowed. </p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-03-05/2lb14ozPerch.jpg" alt="2lb 14oz Perch"><br><img src="/images/2021-03-05/2lb14ozPerchMouth.jpg" alt="2lb 14oz Perch Mouth"></p>
<p><strong>Peg 5 strikes again</strong><br>I tried in peg 4, it’s the first time that I have been able to fish there because it is too overgrown in summer time. So, onto peg 5 which had produced a nice bag of Perch a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>Again I tried bread and cheesepaste first in case there were any Chub around but, once again, the lobworm was the bait because the Perch were definitely on the hunt. Apparently they breed before most of our coarse fish so were feeding up before their important business. That also explains why several of them had fat bellies.</p>
<p>I managed a further 14 Perch, 2 of them being over 2lb. </p>
<p>So, my total for the day was 17 Perch, 4 being over 2lb and one being a PB for an estimated total weight of 22lb - a really enjoyable day.</p>

        <p><em>Level 9.8m</em><br><em>Ellenthorpe Middle - Peg 25</em><br><strong>Lovely Day - eventually</strong><br>The weather has been much nicer as of late. However, we have had a ground frost for the past couple of nights. There hasn’t been any rain for the past few days so the level is near normal and the clarity is improving. It was frosty when I awoke but there was no fog. By the time I had got my gear together and had breakfast, a thickish fog appeared. This fog was not forecast (until tomorrow) but hung around until about 11:30 so kept the temperature down. Once it started to clear, the sun came out and it felt very spring-like. The birds were singing and there was warmth in the sun. In fact, by mid-afternoon, I was sat without my coat or fleece and it was very pleasant.</p>
<p><strong>Two lines</strong><br>After the tentative Perch bites of last week, I decided to go down from a 4oz to a 2oz tip. I therefore fished that rod close into a downstream bush and the other rod out into mid-river. I intended to use a small blockend feeder on both rods putting a mixture of liquidised bread and chopped worm close in and a mixture of groundbait and chopped worm mid river.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing in fog</strong><br>I had no real bites until the fog had gone. Then, in mid-river, I started to get twitches on lobworm tail. I did not strike the first few but then decided to hit the next one and got a lovely fat Perch of 1lb 9oz. I ended up with two Perch and a Roach but these were all very shy bites in mid river.</p>
<p>On the close-in line I alternated between worm, punched bread, cheesepaste and lobworm. I did get a bite on bread but missed it. Other than that, nothing happened on that line.</p>

        <p><em>Level 10.8m</em><br><strong>Temperature Rising</strong><br>The temperature has been rising over the past week. It was below zero all day when I fish one week ago but has been into double figures this week. Unfortunately there has been more rain so I have been watching the river level prediction like a hawk. At one point it looked like the level would be too high for today but it went down again and was just over a metre up from its normal level. I therefore decided to try Ings Lane Bottom again to see if the Chub were more active today. The forecast was for rain and gusty winds so had to take my brolly and probably have to stay in one peg - no roaming.</p>
<p><strong>Best Made Plans!</strong><br>I got a suprise as I arrived at the lane that goes to the river - it was closed! At this point I might have decided on the Corn Dryers but the strong winds would have been right in my face and not pleasant considering the expected rain. So I decided to go the the Cricket Field stretch.</p>
<p>I walked down to the river and was suprised by how much the bank had changed. There were lots of up-ended treed and bushes around the waterline. It also looked very different from my previous visit due to the fact that all of the Himalayan Balsam was gone leaving large clear areas of mud. Peg 5 looked fishable and had been good for me in the summer. I decided to also have a look further along but then noticed an earth-mover on its way to repair the banks. I decided to wait until it stopped to see where it would be working. They produce a fair amount of vibration so would not want to fish too near them. It stopped around peg 12/13 so looked like peg 5 was the place to be.</p>
<p><strong>Early Indications</strong><br>I fished toward the downstream bush. I had one rod close in with a size 16 hook and a couple of Dendra tips.The other rod was a bit further out and just on the inside of the crease with a size 6 and breadflake. It wasn’t long before I got light twitches on the breadflake. There was nothing hittable but showed there was something in the swim. Could be shy Chub or more likely Roach nipping at the bread. After a few more twitches I decided to try some cheesepaste. Yet again, quick taps but no real bites. After a while things settled down and there we no more twitches.</p>
<p><strong>Lunchtime Lobbies</strong><br>I had been throwing in small balls (smaller than a golf ball) of chopped worm mixed in with soil and liquidised bread. So, around 12:30 I started to use lobworm on the close in rod. I quickly saw very subtle taps on the tip eventually hitting into a nice sized Perch. The shy Perch bites continued throughout most of the afternoon resulting in this nice net of winter fish - the biggest was close to 2lb.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-02-19/12lb10ozPerchBag.jpg" alt="12lb 10oz Perch Bag"></p>
<p>I decided to alternate between breadflake and luncheon meat on the further out rod. This was in the hope of a Chub turning up. I did get a few taps on meat but nothing I could strike at.</p>

        <p><strong>Cold Winter Day</strong><br>It has been very cold for the past few days. It was -7 yesterday morning and -5 when I awoke this morning. I am glad that we have a local river as all of the ponds and canals are frozen solid.</p>
<p>As I headed out today I knew that there was only one species that might take a bait today - the wily old Chub! So I went armed with Dendrobaena, Lobworms, Cheesepaste, Bread and Luncheon Meat. I arrived about 9:45am.</p>
<p>I had only been using one rod with a roving approach on my recent trips but none of these resulted in a fish. So, I decided to take 2 rods to increase my chances. I had also been using a size 6 hook on these trips so decided to take some rigs made up with size 14 and 16 in case the 6s were too heavy and putting off shy biting fish. I fished peg 7 at Ings Lane Bottom. There are bushes to my left and right so I fished one rod to each bush. </p>
<p>I fished a size 16 with lobworm tail to my right and a size 6 with breadflake to my left. Within the first 90 minutes I got a few taps on breadflake but none were hittable. They could have been line bites or fish just nipping off bits of bread - either way it showed that were fish in the swim. I also got a tap on worm of the right hand rod but again, not hittable. At least my confidence was now quite high.</p>
<p>I then decided to try a smaller piece of breadflake on the size 16 to my right hand side. The hook wasn’t really big enough for the bread but I thought it was worth a try. At about 12:10, after the bread had been in for about 10 minutes, I got a proper bite and hit into a nice hard fighting Chub. I had to apply lots of side strain to stop it reaching the bush. It was great to see a decent sized fish as I brought it up to the surface. The end result was this lovely 4lb 2oz Chub. It felt quite hollow so could be much heavier if it filled out a bit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2021-02-12/4lb2ozChub.jpg" alt="4lb 2oz Chub"></p>
<p>This really got my hopes up. However, no matter what I tried I could not get another bite.</p>
<p>I decided to take out my keepnet with about 30 minutes to go. This would give it a chance to drip-dry. However it froze solid! It’s the first time I have had to collapse a frozen net (like a large spring). Also, when taking off my hook length, my pear-shaped lead had been on the ground for no more than 2 minutes - when I lifted my rod, the lead had frozen to the ground. It really was a chilly day.</p>
