        <p><strong>More Chub</strong></p>
<p>I had hoped to go to the river on Sunday evening but it was very windy and raining and, worst of all, the river was rising.</p>
<p>Today the weather is much better and the level is just starting to fall. I fished peg 14 again and rather than being 5-6 feet above the water as I had been on previous visits, this time I was just a few inches above the river.</p>
<p>I tried so cheese paste that I had made but it was too soft/sticky and was very difficult to cast. I did manage to gently swing out a lump and got a bite pretty quickly but missed it. I will firm up the paste tomorrow and look forward to trying it again. </p>
<p>I then tried lobworm and bread. Nothing on lobworm and some tentative bites on bread that I could not hit. Then tried caster to no avail.</p>
<p>I then swung out a lump of meat straight in front of  me and just this side of the flow. After a few mins the rod bent around and I was into the following 4lb Chub. It fought really well: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-06/cfed219ec4e14b7b9de7aac4c4bd50b9.jpg" alt="4lb Chub and it&#39;s big mouth"></p>
<p>I got no more bites out in front of me so tried the slack just in front of the downstream bush. It was hard to judge the bush as a lot of it was submerged and I snagged up a few times. Eventually I got the placement right and was rewarded with a 3lb 4oz Chub also to meat.</p>
<p>Both of tonight’s fish fell to my feeder rod instead of the Barbel rod. This also had 6lb rather than 8lb line. The Chub gave a great fight on that gear.</p>
<p>Alas, I then hit into a Barbel on that same rod and near the bush - again on meat. It took me straight into the bush but I got it out. After several lunges into the main flow it finally snapped me about 2 inch from my hook. I think the line had been weakened rubbing in the bush. I never saw the fish so can’t estimate it’s weight.</p>
<p>Here is the end result of my session: -</p>

<p>This was a thoroughly enjoyable session and was crowned off by this marvellous sunset: -</p>

        <p><strong>Harder going today</strong></p>
<p>I could not resist another attempt at peg 14. I had intended to fish from about 9:30am through the day but wanted to get in peg 14 before anyone else arrived so left home at 6:30. I was gutted when I arrived to find 2 cars already there and I knew one was Kevin’s and was sure he would be in peg 14. Never mind, I trudged along to the river and passed all of the earlier pegs with no sign of Kevin. I was amazed to find peg 14 free so was in it like a shot! Kevin had chosen the next peg along :-)</p>
<p>It was quite windy and getting windier. Bites were very fickle and few and far between and hard to see in the wind. I tried meat, lobworms, casters, cheese and nothing produced a proper bite, just little pecks.</p>
<p>After several hours I tried a lump of flake on the bomb. It had hardly settled when I got my first proper bite but missed it. The second cast resulted in another quick bite but no fish. I did not get any other so had an idea. </p>
<p>I had brought my Avon rod so set that up with a large Avon float. It was quite difficult due to a gusty downstream wind and a swirling current but, after many attempts and changes of depth, I managed to get the float to trot right into the bush. Wham, it shot under and the result was this 4lb Chub. I really enjoyed catching it on the float as I felt I had earned it and outwitted the fish.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-03/088c58691f584133a5d1d7cc2b9655c0.jpg" alt="4lb Chub"></p>
<p>The day just got windier and windier making float fishing impossible. My last cast of the day on the bomb resulted in this smaller Chub.</p>

<p>Having learned the lesson yesterday, I did set up my camera straight away. I attach it to a bankstick then have a cable to the camera so that I can take the picture whilst holding the fish. One downside of this is the British weather - it rained several times today. So, thinking cap on…</p>

        <p><strong>Finally, I found some nice fish</strong></p>
<p>Having had 2 blank sessions on peg 11 yesterday, I arrived to find peg 14 free. I decided to give it a go after the recent catches from that peg.</p>
<p>My trench spade had arrived so used it to clear a decent space for my chair. It was still precarious on that peg as you are about 5 feet above the water and sit on a small plateau that looks undercut beneath it. I had to be very careful when reaching to put out the keepnet.</p>
<p>I started with 2 rods, one near the downstream bush that is known to hold Chub and one in front of me just this side of the main flow. This was still quite strong after the high levels of the past few days. I fished lobworm and bomb on both after putting in several bait droppers of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets and 2mm cubes of luncheon meat.</p>
<p>I had my first bite within about 15 mins on the rod out in front of me. This resulted in a nice sized Perch. After another hour or so I was getting a few tentative pecks at my bait so I twitched it to evoke a bite and finally got a Chub near the downstream bush. It was not big but was so enjoyable as it was my first from the River Ure.</p>
<p>After another hour or so I had no bites so decided to put on a blockend feeder that had enlarged holes to let the loosefeed mix escape. I fished this near the bush with a lobworm but got no interest. I then decided to try 5 casters on my size 8 hook. This hadn’t been in too long when I had a bite (quite tentative) and struck into a hard fighting Barbel that took me straight into the bush despite me trying lots of sidestrain to keep it out. Once it got snagged I released the pressure for a few seconds and the fish left the bush and headed for mid river. Several minutes later I got it to the surface and realised it was a decent size. Netting the fish was a challenge - my 2.5m landing net handle only just reached. Another note to self; buy a longer handle.</p>
<p>Having banked the fish I was so pleased. I immediately weighed it at 8lb 10oz. Unfortunately I hadn’t bothered to setup my camera so had to make do with the following photo taken with my phone. I wanted to revive and return it asap (too big for keepnet) so no time to waste setting up the camera. Another note to self; always set up camera before fishing!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-02/33ba30dff6a547ff8b8b6fa4d0867e9f.jpg" alt="8lb 10oz Barbel"></p>
<p>I immediately setup my camera just in case there were more Barbel around. I fished for another hour or so and managed one more small Chub. This had been a thoroughly enjoyable evening after the 3 previous blank sessions. I took the following of the fish that I had kept in my keepnet.</p>

        <p><strong>Second attempt today</strong></p>
<p>After the earlier shenanigans with the dog and having seen reports of catches today,  I fancied an evening session.</p>
<p>Went back to peg 11 hoping that my earlier loose feed might have attracted some fish. However it was another fish-less trip. I did manage a couple of taps on the meat. One bite was such a wrap around that I was certain to hook up - alas I struck into nothing!</p>
<p>There was a small puddle in front of me that was draining as the river receded. There were a few small fry and this little freshwater shrimp showing that the river was alive with natural food for the fish:-</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-01/78bddd0b4c8e4abbb91371306f4a847e.jpg" alt="Freshwater Shrimp"></p>
<p>I had seen that more rain was forecast but expected it to be light so I left my 7kg brolly in the car - it is a fair walk and I am sure I am getting shorter lugging all that gear! Big mistake, the rain was heavier and more persistent than I expected. I got soaked and am just glad that I didn’t have any maggots with me.</p>

        <p><strong>Try again on a falling river</strong></p>
<p>The river is falling and is about 2 feet overdepth so an early start is the order of the day.</p>
<p>Got up at 3:30am and left the house at 4am. Fished peg 11 and slipped down the last part of the bank resulting in me being sat in a muddy puddle - note to self; buy a small trench spade!</p>
<p>I was expecting to fish just out from the small bush that should be downstream of me. However I could not see it so assumed it was still submerged.</p>
<p>I started with half a dozen bait-droppers of a mix of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, 2mm diced meat and 2mm diced cheddar. I fished meat, lobworms and halibut pellets over the loose feed but not a bite.</p>
<p>I did not have a signal so was unable to check the dog via the internal camera. However about 6am I got a signal and she appeared calm, laid on the sofa but was howling like a wolf every 30 seconds or so. I have seen her do that before but she usually stops after 1 or 2 howls but not this time. I was concerned about her disturbing the neighbours so paked up quickly and was home for 6:30 - dog was fine so back to bed after another blank session.</p>
<p>Later in the morning I went to apologise to the neighbours but they hadn’t heard a thing. From now on I will fish daytime or evening when there is less chance of her waking anyone should she howl again.</p>
<p>I also had a look on Amazon and got myself this trench spade. At 40cm long and fairly lightweight, its just the job for slippery river banks: -</p>

        <p><strong>Worth a try, nearly in flood</strong></p>
<p>Saw that the level was rising today so thought it worth a try in the evening. Fished peg 3 and water was already 1.5m up. It continued to rise at about a foot per hour. Tried meat, halibut pellets and cheese. No bites. Lost a few weights of the 1.3oz size. Good thing is that they held bottom ok and even the lightest barbel rod tip seemed ok.</p>
<p>Gonna try again on Tue and Wed morning. Hopefully level will have dropped by then and more manageable.</p>

        <p><strong>Big baits - sit and wait</strong></p>
<p>Went into 1st entrace, parked at the second entrance to the river.</p>
<p>Fished to the right (upstream) of the gate and 2 pegs before the wires.</p>
<p>Fished from 18:00 until 21:00. I decided to concentrate on big baits and bomb. I did not get any bites but that’s fine; I was holding out for big fish.</p>
<p><strong>Escape route</strong><br>If you have read about me getting locked in on my previous visit then it may tickle you to realise that I found another road off the Ellenthorpe estate that does NOT seem to have a lockable gate!</p>

        <p>The club held a match on the Cricket Field stretch of the river. I had a ride out to see how they got on.</p>
<p>The match was one with just over 5lb consisting of small fish although one or two nice Dace and Perch.</p>
<p>One guy had a Barbel on his 2nd cast but it took him straight into a snag and got away.</p>
<p>Another guy had a Chub of over 3lb and lost 2 or 3 others that all snagged him up on the bush that he was forced to fish tight against - couldn’t get a bite otherwise.</p>
<p>That spurred me onto a session with only big baits. See my next posting.</p>

        <p><strong>Ellenthorpe Corn Dryers</strong> </p>
<p>Went into 1st entrace, parked near corn dryers.</p>
<p>Fished to the right (upstream) of the gate. Went just before the corner right at the far end of the first line of trees opposite. Had a gap in farside trees opposite me.</p>
<p>Mid river was about 11ft deep and very slow flowing.</p>
<p>Fished from 2:30 until 22:00. Decided to go all out on maggot in the hope of encouraging Chub or Barbel to feed. I used maggot feeder and got bites from the first cast. I got plenty of small knocks and fish but unfortunately they were all small Roach, Dace and Bleak. I did manage three Perch that were bigger than the other fish but not huge. I also tried the Avon float but there was a gusting downstream wind that made it almost unfishable with a stick/avon float. I managed a couple of fish on the Avon when the wind dropped occasionally. I gave up on the Avon and tried a Truncheon waggler. This was more controllable but still just small fish. </p>
<p>I did enjoy the session. It was a very busy one, interrupted by heavy downpours, with bites coming very frequently.</p>
<p>Had another small Pike attack my keepnet but I managed to fend it off before it hurt anything.</p>
<p><strong>Nasty Surprise</strong><br>I got to the gate about 22:30 to find that it was locked and all of the farm buildings were in darkness. Thankfully my mum was at my house and able to look after the dog. I also had a fair bit if packup left so slept (rather well) in my car until I could escape at 7:00am!</p>

        <p><strong>Long day at Ellenthorpe</strong><br>Went into 1st entrace, parked near corn dryers.</p>
<p>Fished to the left (downstream) of the gate. Went just around the corner where it narrowed. Had a gap in farside trees opposite me.</p>
<p>Mid river was about 13ft deep and slow flowing.</p>
<p>Fished from 6:30 until 21:00. Had one bite that resulted in one Roach. This was to a maggot on a Dave Harrell 5g Avon float. Never had a knock on feeder on either far side on near pilings on near side. Only tried large baits on feeder.</p>
<p>Saw several Salmon swirling and even leaping.</p>
<p>A small Pike attacked my keepnet and latched onto the Roach. I had to force the Pike off my net. The Roach died later.</p>
