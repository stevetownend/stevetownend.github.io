        <p>I decided on a session during the day today. Firstly I needed to get a sandwich from the bakery so an early start was out of the question. Secondly, I wanted to work out if the river fished ok during the day. Having spent most of my life fishing ponds and canals, I know that early morning and late evening are the best times to go but hear that rivers are more consistent during the day. I have yet to prove that to myself.</p>
<p>I fished peg 3 again. The river was about 18” higher than it was on Wednesday evening and was falling. I therefore had to fish from a higher position.</p>
<p>I setup my lighter tip rod (6lb line) for fishing cheese paste and bread up to the downstream tree/bush. The idea being that this was most likely to pickup Chub and I liked playing them on the lighter rod. I would setup my Barbel rod and fish meat / caster / lobworm mid river (or just this side of the main flow) in the hope of picking up Barbel.</p>
<p>I also used a new technique of supergluing a piece of expanded foam (from some product packaging) onto the shank of a size 8 hook. This would help secure the cheese paste and bread flake and would also counterbalance the weight of the hook somewhat.</p>
<p>I swung out my cheese paste near the tree and started to setup my Barbel rod. The cheese paste had not been in 5 minutes before a very good bite - that I missed! This set my expectations for a good day!</p>
<p>The forecast for today was for overcast cloudy skies and frequent rain. However the first 3 hours were very sunny and quite hot. I am not sure if this affected the fishing but I struggled to get any other bites. I checked the forecast again and it looked like the rain had moved to around lunchtime. Therefore I decided to setup the float rod whilst the weather was reasonable in the hope that I could run some cheese paste or breadflake near the tree and see if they wanted a moving bait. I decided to try a 2AAA Truncheon Waggler rather than an Avon float this time. This did not result in any bites.</p>
<p>The level had now fallen to the point where I could get to a lower plateau that was close to the water line. I decided to move down before the rains came. It is much nicer fishing near the water line. This was a good move as the rain appeared soon after and with no real warning - went from sunny to heavy rain almost instantaneously!</p>
<p>Around this time I started to get knocks on breadflake near the tree. I alternated between flake and cheese paste and eventually breadflake accounted for a good bite and the following Chub of about 2.5lb. Interestingly it had bite marks on both sides and I did wonder if it was the same fish that I caught on Wednesday that came with a Pike attached. In some ways, I hope it was because that proves that the fish survived.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-10/a9dccf46c3c840f3b7b81151c6f7fdae.jpg" alt="2.5lb Chub"></p>
<p>This Chub gave a decent account of itself and was significant in that I set myself a target of 10 Chub from the Ure in my first season - this was no.10 and came within a week of my 1st Chub. So now it’s time for a new target - I think a 5lb+ Chub should be my aim now.</p>
<p>Although I had a few more knocks, there were no more positive bites despite the cloud and rain.</p>
<p>So my thoughts are turning to my next session; I think I will give this weekend a miss as I have been quite tired and was falling asleep several times today. I think that my next evening session will involve roving between pegs because it looks to me like cheese paste and breadflake result in fairly quick bites when swung near a tree/bush if there are any Chub in residence. That will also mean that I can travel very lightly and will just have to risk the odd soaking - hopefully the new Diawa Retex bib-brace and coat with waxed hat will keep the worst of the rain out.</p>

        <p>The forecast was for light showers tonight so I hauled my brolly along and decided to give peg 3 a go. I had fished this when the river was really high and I wanted to know what it was like when the river was low. This will help me understand where I can fish when the level is back up again.</p>
<p>It was a very slippery track down to the peg so I was thankful for my trench spade. </p>
<p>I had made up a couple of hook lengths with a small piece of expended foam on a hair. This, along with some stiffened cheese paste would allow me to fish the paste and see if it really does work.</p>
<p>Within 30 minutes I had the following 3lb 8oz Chub. I had had several knocks on cheese paste right from the off and this one finally took the bait properly. It tried to snag me under the near back but I finally netted it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-08/0fc2c74419c242699b3ac5ece5f7df8a.jpg" alt="3lb 8oz Chub"></p>
<p>I was fishing meat on the other rod and also tried caster. I never got a proper bite all night.</p>
<p>After another hour or so I managed a much smaller Chub (about 1 pound) on cheese paste again.</p>
<p>Then the rains started. It was constant heavy rain for the rest of the evening. I am so glad I brought along my brolly - and spade to help me escape at the end!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-08/6eb67ac584a746929e34b98681a0a654.jpg" alt="Light showers - yeah right!"></p>
<p>I did not get any more bites on cheese paste so used meat on both rods. The one that was in the same place as I had been finishing cheese paste eventually wrapped around. At first I thought it was a Chub and then it made a dart for the middle of the river so I assumed it was a Barbel that had woken up. After several minutes I got it to the surface to find that it was a Chub of about 2lb - with a huge Pike clamped onto the Chub! I managed to get the head and half of the body in my landing net and was just dragging it up the bank when it flipped out of the net and let go of the Chub and left it in my landing net. Thankfully the Chub survived. I have never caught a big Pike so can’t estimate it’s weight but my landing net is 20” across and I only managed to get aboyut half of the Pike in my net. Oh what a photo that would have been.</p>
<p>The swim went very quite for about 30 minutes after that. I had been getting frequent pecks at the meat but I guess a big Pike in the area put paid to that for a while. I did manage a few more pecks at meat before I decided to call it a day.</p>
<p>So, in summary: -</p>
<ul>
<li>3lb 8oz Chub</li>
<li>2lb Chub</li>
<li>1lb Chub</li>
<li>and half a Pike!</li>

        <p><strong>More Chub</strong></p>
<p>I had hoped to go to the river on Sunday evening but it was very windy and raining and, worst of all, the river was rising.</p>
<p>Today the weather is much better and the level is just starting to fall. I fished peg 14 again and rather than being 5-6 feet above the water as I had been on previous visits, this time I was just a few inches above the river.</p>
<p>I tried some cheese paste that I had made but it was too soft/sticky and was very difficult to cast. I did manage to gently swing out a lump and got a bite pretty quickly but missed it. I will firm up the paste tomorrow and look forward to trying it again. </p>
<p>I then tried lobworm and bread. Nothing on lobworm and some tentative bites on bread that I could not hit. Then tried caster to no avail.</p>
<p>I then swung out a lump of meat straight in front of  me and just this side of the flow. After a few mins the rod bent around and I was into the following 4lb Chub. It fought really well: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-06/cfed219ec4e14b7b9de7aac4c4bd50b9.jpg" alt="4lb Chub and it&#39;s big mouth"></p>
<p>I got no more bites out in front of me so tried the slack just in front of the downstream bush. It was hard to judge the bush as a lot of it was submerged and I snagged up a few times. Eventually I got the placement right and was rewarded with a 3lb 4oz Chub also to meat.</p>
<p>Both of tonight’s fish fell to my feeder rod instead of the Barbel rod. This also had 6lb rather than 8lb line. The Chub gave a great fight on that gear.</p>
<p>Alas, I then hit into a Barbel on that same rod and near the bush - again on meat. It took me straight into the bush but I got it out. After several lunges into the main flow it finally snapped me about 2 inch from my hook. I think the line had been weakened rubbing in the bush. I never saw the fish so can’t estimate it’s weight.</p>
<p>Here is the end result of my session: -</p>

<p>This was a thoroughly enjoyable session and was crowned off by this marvellous sunset: -</p>

        <p><strong>Harder going today</strong></p>
<p>I could not resist another attempt at peg 14. I had intended to fish from about 9:30am through the day but wanted to get in peg 14 before anyone else arrived so left home at 6:30. I was gutted when I arrived to find 2 cars already there and I knew one was Kevin’s and was sure he would be in peg 14. Never mind, I trudged along to the river and passed all of the earlier pegs with no sign of Kevin. I was amazed to find peg 14 free so was in it like a shot! Kevin had chosen the next peg along :-)</p>
<p>It was quite windy and getting windier. Bites were very fickle and few and far between and hard to see in the wind. I tried meat, lobworms, casters, cheese and nothing produced a proper bite, just little pecks.</p>
<p>After several hours I tried a lump of flake on the bomb. It had hardly settled when I got my first proper bite but missed it. The second cast resulted in another quick bite but no fish. I did not get any other so had an idea. </p>
<p>I had brought my Avon rod so set that up with a large Avon float. It was quite difficult due to a gusty downstream wind and a swirling current but, after many attempts and changes of depth, I managed to get the float to trot right into the bush. Wham, it shot under and the result was this 4lb Chub. I really enjoyed catching it on the float as I felt I had earned it and outwitted the fish.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-03/088c58691f584133a5d1d7cc2b9655c0.jpg" alt="4lb Chub"></p>
<p>The day just got windier and windier making float fishing impossible. My last cast of the day on the bomb resulted in this smaller Chub.</p>

<p>Having learned the lesson yesterday, I did set up my camera straight away. I attach it to a bankstick then have a cable to the camera so that I can take the picture whilst holding the fish. One downside of this is the British weather - it rained several times today. So, thinking cap on…</p>

        <p><strong>Finally, I found some nice fish</strong></p>
<p>Having had 2 blank sessions on peg 11 yesterday, I arrived to find peg 14 free. I decided to give it a go after the recent catches from that peg.</p>
<p>My trench spade had arrived so used it to clear a decent space for my chair. It was still precarious on that peg as you are about 5 feet above the water and sit on a small plateau that looks undercut beneath it. I had to be very careful when reaching to put out the keepnet.</p>
<p>I started with 2 rods, one near the downstream bush that is known to hold Chub and one in front of me just this side of the main flow. This was still quite strong after the high levels of the past few days. I fished lobworm and bomb on both after putting in several bait droppers of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets and 2mm cubes of luncheon meat.</p>
<p>I had my first bite within about 15 mins on the rod out in front of me. This resulted in a nice sized Perch. After another hour or so I was getting a few tentative pecks at my bait so I twitched it to evoke a bite and finally got a Chub near the downstream bush. It was not big but was so enjoyable as it was my first from the River Ure.</p>
<p>After another hour or so I had no bites so decided to put on a blockend feeder that had enlarged holes to let the loosefeed mix escape. I fished this near the bush with a lobworm but got no interest. I then decided to try 5 casters on my size 8 hook. This hadn’t been in too long when I had a bite (quite tentative) and struck into a hard fighting Barbel that took me straight into the bush despite me trying lots of sidestrain to keep it out. Once it got snagged I released the pressure for a few seconds and the fish left the bush and headed for mid river. Several minutes later I got it to the surface and realised it was a decent size. Netting the fish was a challenge - my 2.5m landing net handle only just reached. Another note to self; buy a longer handle.</p>
<p>Having banked the fish I was so pleased. I immediately weighed it at 8lb 10oz. Unfortunately I hadn’t bothered to setup my camera so had to make do with the following photo taken with my phone. I wanted to revive and return it asap (too big for keepnet) so no time to waste setting up the camera. Another note to self; always set up camera before fishing!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-02/33ba30dff6a547ff8b8b6fa4d0867e9f.jpg" alt="8lb 10oz Barbel"></p>
<p>I immediately setup my camera just in case there were more Barbel around. I fished for another hour or so and managed one more small Chub. This had been a thoroughly enjoyable evening after the 3 previous blank sessions. I took the following of the fish that I had kept in my keepnet.</p>

        <p><strong>Second attempt today</strong></p>
<p>After the earlier shenanigans with the dog and having seen reports of catches today,  I fancied an evening session.</p>
<p>Went back to peg 11 hoping that my earlier loose feed might have attracted some fish. However it was another fish-less trip. I did manage a couple of taps on the meat. One bite was such a wrap around that I was certain to hook up - alas I struck into nothing!</p>
<p>There was a small puddle in front of me that was draining as the river receded. There were a few small fry and this little freshwater shrimp showing that the river was alive with natural food for the fish:-</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-01/78bddd0b4c8e4abbb91371306f4a847e.jpg" alt="Freshwater Shrimp"></p>
<p>I had seen that more rain was forecast but expected it to be light so I left my 7kg brolly in the car - it is a fair walk and I am sure I am getting shorter lugging all that gear! Big mistake, the rain was heavier and more persistent than I expected. I got soaked and am just glad that I didn’t have any maggots with me.</p>

        <p><strong>Try again on a falling river</strong></p>
<p>The river is falling and is about 2 feet overdepth so an early start is the order of the day.</p>
<p>Got up at 3:30am and left the house at 4am. Fished peg 11 and slipped down the last part of the bank resulting in me being sat in a muddy puddle - note to self; buy a small trench spade!</p>
<p>I was expecting to fish just out from the small bush that should be downstream of me. However I could not see it so assumed it was still submerged.</p>
<p>I started with half a dozen bait-droppers of a mix of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, 2mm diced meat and 2mm diced cheddar. I fished meat, lobworms and halibut pellets over the loose feed but not a bite.</p>
<p>I did not have a signal so was unable to check the dog via the internal camera. However about 6am I got a signal and she appeared calm, laid on the sofa but was howling like a wolf every 30 seconds or so. I have seen her do that before but she usually stops after 1 or 2 howls but not this time. I was concerned about her disturbing the neighbours so paked up quickly and was home for 6:30 - dog was fine so back to bed after another blank session.</p>
<p>Later in the morning I went to apologise to the neighbours but they hadn’t heard a thing. From now on I will fish daytime or evening when there is less chance of her waking anyone should she howl again.</p>
<p>I also had a look on Amazon and got myself this trench spade. At 40cm long and fairly lightweight, its just the job for slippery river banks: -</p>

        <p><strong>Worth a try, nearly in flood</strong></p>
<p>Saw that the level was rising today so thought it worth a try in the evening. Fished peg 3 and water was already 1.5m up. It continued to rise at about a foot per hour. Tried meat, halibut pellets and cheese. No bites. Lost a few weights of the 1.3oz size. Good thing is that they held bottom ok and even the lightest barbel rod tip seemed ok.</p>
<p>Gonna try again on Tue and Wed morning. Hopefully level will have dropped by then and more manageable.</p>

<p>Fished to the right (upstream) of the gate and 2 pegs before the wires.</p>
<p>Fished from 18:00 until 21:00. I decided to concentrate on big baits and bomb. I did not get any bites but that’s fine; I was holding out for big fish.</p>
<p><strong>Escape route</strong><br>If you have read about me getting locked in on my previous visit then it may tickle you to realise that I found another road off the Ellenthorpe estate that does NOT seem to have a lockable gate!</p>

        <p>The club held a match on the Cricket Field stretch of the river. I had a ride out to see how they got on.</p>
<p>The match was one with just over 5lb consisting of small fish although one or two nice Dace and Perch.</p>
<p>One guy had a Barbel on his 2nd cast but it took him straight into a snag and got away.</p>
<p>Another guy had a Chub of over 3lb and lost 2 or 3 others that all snagged him up on the bush that he was forced to fish tight against - couldn’t get a bite otherwise.</p>
<p>That spurred me onto a session with only big baits. See my next posting.</p>
