        <p><strong>Great Expectation</strong><br>Having had a couple of nice Bream from peg 25, I decided on a pre-baiting session to see if I could get a shoal of Bream feeding. Therefore I went out at 7:30am and lunchtime for each day from Mon to Thu, intending to fish it on Friday. I really had no idea how much to feed at this time of year. I decided on 5 or 6 orange-sized balls, twice per day.</p>
<p>As I expected, someone did fish the peg on one of the days (Tue). He had a 10lb Barbel in his keepnet and hooked into what we suspect was a large Bream whilst I was there.</p>
<p>So, finally, Friday arrived. However, so did the 1st real frosts of the year. It was a lomg, cold day where I was receiving lots of single taps on the tip (nothing to strike at). When I had nothing by lunchtime I was doubting that there were any Bream about.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, just before the sun went down, I managed a nice Perch. But no Bream whatsoever.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-11-20/5lbBream.jpg" alt="5lb Bream"></p>
<p>Then around 2:40pm, I hooked into a hard fiting Barbel that was a real surprise. I wasn’t expecting Barbel in late November.</p>

        <p><strong>River up again</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 10.9m and falling slightly.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bbc.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offite Link</a></p>
<p>Arrived around lunchtime for an afternoon session through to dusk. Fished peg 25 again. Having got a new 17ft float road, I was really hoping for a float session today but the high river level put paid to that idea.</p>
<p>So, it was the usual 2 rods. One out in front of me, about 3/4 of the way across on halibut pellet with PVA mesh bags and one downstream on the same bait.</p>
<p><strong>First signs</strong><br>After about 30 minutes I started getting good strong taps on the downstream rod. However these did not turn into hittable bites. So, after 40 minutes I switched the downstream rod to luncheon meat in case Chub had been tapping the pellet but not taking it.</p>
<p><strong>Bream, a first!</strong><br>About 50 minutes into the session I got a bite on pellet and hit into a solid fish. As I brought it in I expected that it was a Barbel that had yet to wake up so was expecting a lunge at any time. Imagine my surprise when it broke the surface and was a lovely river Bream. This is my first on the Ure and my 1st on halibut pellet: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-09/5lb8ozBream.jpg" alt="5lb 8oz Bream"></p>
<p><strong>No action on meat</strong><br>I did not get any interest in the meat so decided to switch to lobworm, this could pick up Barbel, Chub, big Perch or the Bream that were obviously now in the swim. I got a bite within 5 minutes and hit into a decent sized Eel. Thankfully I lip hooked it so was able to unhook it and return it. So, an Eel, that’s another first on the Ure.</p>
<p><strong>Barbel lost</strong><br>About 3 hours into the session I got a Barbel bite that nearly took my rod. I just managed to grab it. This was a typical Barbel fight and I thought that I was going to net it. However, when it got close, it lunged down to a sunken tree to my right. I tried to stop it but my line snapped. I am glad there was no-one around to hear my swearing!</p>
<p><strong>Another Eel</strong><br>After a couple more hours, my lobworm rod went again and it was another Eel. Slightly smaller and lip hooked again. I then decided to go back onto halibut pellet on the downstream rod as I didn’t really want any more Eels.</p>
<p><strong>Twilight Barbel</strong><br>The light was failing fast and I was about 15 minutes away from leaving when I got persistent small taps on my downstream pellet. I waited to see if it would develop into a proper pull around suspecting that a Bream was mouthing the pellet. However it continued to tap so I had to hit it and was surprised that it was a Barbel. It was solid and heavy like a Barbel but didn’t strip line off. As I got it close I was prepared for the lunge but none came so I netted the fish first time: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-09/8lbBarbel.jpg" alt="8lb Barbel"></p>
<p>This fish took a long time to recover in the landing net and I released it after a few minutes. Then it rose to surface again and was struggling. I was able to net it and spent several more minutes holding it to let water flow through it’s gills. It seemed to want to go so I released it and, yet again, it popped up to the surface. So I netted it again and found an area near the end of my peg where I could stand in 8-10 inches of water and cradle the fish to help it right itself. After a while I noticed that it was blowing bubbles out of its mouth and it’s gill covers. That’s obviously what had been causing it distress. I also noticed that the skin around where its dorsal fin met it’s body seemed very pale as if the fish was ill. This is perhaps why it hand’t fought the way I expected. Eventually I was able to release the fish and it seemed to swim away fine.</p>

        <p><strong>Tue 6th, River falling fast</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 10.5m and falling.</em></strong></p>
<p>The river was falling fast since its very high level on Sunday. I have heard that the Ure fishes better when falling rather than the norm which is to fish better when rising (for Barbel). I was therefore keen to head out again to peg 25 for a couple of hours after work.</p>
<p>I decided to fish both rods on the halibut pellet and PVA mesh bags. One almost straight out in front and one downstream, both between 3/4 across and the far side. </p>
<p><strong>Quick fish - lost!</strong>‘<br>I got a bite on my downstream rod after about 25 minutes (around 5pm) and hit into a Barbel that seemed relatively calm. That is, until it got near to the surface. It then lunged down and I could not stop it’s run into the depths just in front of me. After a few seconds my line snapped. Upon inspection, about 5 - 6m of line had suffered major abrasion. I suspect the Barbel took me through an underwater bush/tree before snapping me. So, I discarded that line and set up again. </p>
<p><strong>Missed bite</strong><br>Around 5:30pm it started to rain so I began to put up my brolly. The Barbel must have been watching as that was a stimulus for my downstream rod to go again. I managed to get to it and struck, fully expecting to connect with the fish but there was nothing there - arghhh!</p>
<p><strong>Tap tap tap</strong><br>From about 6:15pm until dark (7pm), I was getting taps and little pulls on both rods. These tended to happen after I twitched the bait a bit. None of these turned into hittable bites. Whilst I had not banked any fish tonight, I really enjoyed it because the Barbel were around and I felt that I had found another good stretch after my very unproductive September.</p>
<p>I have also ordered a 17ft float rod so that I can have a few float sessions and hopefully get some nice Roach, Chub, Perch and maybe Bream. It is very deep at Ellenthorpe so the long rod should really help.</p>
<p><strong>Wed 7th, River almost normal</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 9.8m and falling slightly.</em></strong></p>
<p>I was still full of expectation from my previous evening so could not resist another couple of hours in peg 25. When I got there I could see signs of someone else having been in the peg but then noticed that the overhanging bush/tree had been cut back a bit. So I was not sure if it was a fisherman or a working party preparing for Sunday’s match. I decided to fish peg 25 anyway.</p>
<p>Despite my heightened expectations I did not get any signs of fish until about 6pm. I then got little taps on both rods but no firm bites. Again, this was after twitching the bait a bit.</p>
<p>I decided to pack up at 7pm (a few mins earlier than my previous visits). However, at 6:55pm my upstream rod bent over and I hit into a very hard fighting Barbel. After a good scrap I landed this lovely 9lb 10oz fish: - </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-07/9lb10ozBarbel.jpg" alt="9lb 10oz Barbel"></p>
<p>It is interesting that this fish also has a nick in the top of it’s tail fin. I have now had 3 fish with similar nicks (2 of them were similar weights so could have been the same fish).</p>

        <p><strong>Trying a new peg</strong><br>I arrived just after mid-day, planning to fish until dusk. I decided on peg 25 at Ellenthorpe - middle stretch. Other than the fact that there seem to be Barbel around here, another plus is that it is a very short walk from the car which is parked just the other side of the flood bank. This means that I can take lots of stuff with me just in case e.g. brolly, extra feeders, leads etc and even an extra rod in case I want to give the float a go. These can all stay in the car until needed.</p>
<p>Peg 25 was a very comfortable peg. It had a nice flat area to each side of my chair and a small promontary just in front of my chair which gave plenty of room to stand, play fish etc. Caution is advised though - the water is about 10 feet deep right at the water’s edge!</p>
<p><strong>Plan for the day</strong><br>I decided to fish the Barbel rod straight out in front of me, about 3/4 across the river (with halibut pellet and PVA mesh bag) and my Chub rod further downstream and roughly mid-river. On this rod I would start with lobworm in the hope of either Barbel, Chub, Perch or Bream and then alternate with luncheon meat that I was also trying in PVA mesh for the 1st time.</p>
<p><strong>Pellet is king</strong><br>My first bite came about 3:40pm on the Barbel rod with halibut pellet. I was actually just changing bait on the Chub rod when I saw the Barbel bite. This was fortunate as I did not need to worry about getting snagged up in the second rod/line.</p>
<p>The Barbel, as usual, fought really well. However, the deep water close in seemed to spur the fish onto continual lunges into the depths whenever I thought I was about to net it. I was just hoping there were no bad snags down there. Thankfully it seemed clear enough and I eventually netted this lovely 9lb fish: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/9lbBarbel.jpg" alt="9lb Barbel"></p>
<p>I decided to use a keepnet for the Barbel. This is not something that I would normally do but I have seen many club members using a net and the fish seem non the worse for wear. This would allow me to photograph several fish together if I was ever lucky enough to catch more than one - I haven’t so far on the Ure.</p>
<p>Having got a fish mid afternoon I was hopeful of getting at least one more before the session ended. However it was a very long and uneventful afternoon and evening. I did not get a single knock on the Chub rod and only that one bite on the Barbel rod. I did notice that the halibut pellets fell off the hair a couple of times before I even cast in - I need to find a solution to that otherwise I will be sat there for ages with no bait on the hook!</p>
<p><strong>Late appearance</strong><br>I decided to pack up and had just pulled up my keepnet (Barbel not yet released) when my Barbel rod crashed into the water in front of me. I initially thought I may have hit the rod rest and knocked it off but then saw the tip bending around and heading downstream. I quickly released the netted Barbel and was easily able to grab the rod and had a relatively calm fight (in Barbel terms) with this 7lb 4oz fish: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/7lb4ozBarbel.jpg" alt="7lb 4oz Barbel"></p>
<p>This one had a noticeable nick in the bottom of it’s tail fin.</p>
<p><strong>A new first</strong><br>This is the first time that I have managed more than 1 Barbel in a session on the Ure. I wasn’t able to get a photo of both together due to the unfashionably late arrival of the second fish. Maybe next time I will go all out and use halibut pellet on both rods so see if I can beat 2 in a session.</p>
<p><strong>Two days later, up again</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Level 13.4m and peaking.</em></strong></p>
<p>After a lousy Saturday where we all experienced a lot of rain, the river was rising most of the day on Sunday. It looked to be peaking around 4pm so decided to try a couple of hours until dusk. Whilst I was expecting it to be up by 3 metres from Friday, I didn’t really appreciate what that meant having not fished this stretch very much. When I got there the river was well over it’s normal banks and working it’s way up the flood bank. The following photo shows just how high it was - I would normally be fishing in that line of trees that are 10m out in the river!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-02/Flood.jpg" alt="Flood"></p>
<p>I was only able to fish one rod due to the strong flow and did not get any bites despite trying halibut pellet, luncheon meat and lobworm. I did manage to loose one lead but it was a lovely evening once I got sat under the brolly for the occasional shower that showed up. The river looked lovely as the sun was dipping down over the trees: -</p>

        <p><strong>Recent Sessions</strong><br>For the past couple of weeks I have been focussing on the Ellenthorpe stretch. Last Friday I spent 8 hours at the Corn Dryers in a very strong wind (too gusty for the brolly) with frequent showers. The river was also up about 1.5m. It was a miserable day without a single bite. </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-01/InFlood.jpg" alt="Wild day"></p>
<p>So, my next trip focussed on Perch at the Corn Dryers. I also put out my Barbel rod with halibut pellet - just in case. Nothing on the Barbel rod but I did get quite a few Perch. I was certain that one of them would break my 3lb target as it looked huge - it turned out to be 2lb 6oz. Still a nice fish but not the catch I thought it was. I then spent a lovely evening on the stick float at the Corn Dryers in the hope of picking up Perch, perhaps Roach, Bream or Chub as I was using lobworm. However, I only managed a few smallish Perch. The weather was really nice and the river was very calming after a busy day at work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-01/DuskySky.jpg" alt="Sky at dusk"></p>
<p><strong>Tonight’s session</strong><br>I nipped out for a 2 hour session after work (it gets dark so early now). I went to Ellenthorpe middle - peg 26. I fished one rod with halibut pellet and a PVA mesh bag of freebies and one rod with lobworm. Both were fished in mid river.</p>
<p><strong>My best Barbel on the Ure</strong><br>After about 45 minutes (about 6pm) I got a solid bite on the halibut pellet and had a great fight from a feisty 11lb Barbel. This equals my best ever Barbel (on the Swale about 30 years ago - yikes!). It also has a very noticable nick on it’s tail fin. </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-10-01/11lbBarbel.jpg" alt="11lb Barbel"></p>
<p>I have seen a few reports of Barbel at Ellenthorpe and weighed a friend’s Barbel as I arrived tonight. His was a shade under 10lb. Hopefully I have re-located the Barbel. I am expecting a plumber tomorrow, I hope he comes early so that I can go back and try for more on a longer session.</p>

        <p><strong>Summary</strong><br>I have not had many trips since my week off work which also co-incided with a week of heavy rains. I have had an average of one trip per week rather than my usual three per week whilst I caught up on some jobs that I needed to do around the house. Even on these weekly trips the fishing has been hard. I have really struggled to find Barbel and big Chub. This post summaries these recent trips.</p>
<p>The upshot is that I think the Barbel and Chub have now moved down river so I will concentrate my efforts one the three Ellenthorpe stretches from now on. Hopefully I can locate the big fish again.</p>
<p><strong>New Backpack</strong><br>During my week off, one of the straps broke on the backpack that I had been using. This was probably because it was getting soaked every day. To be honest it was a cheap backpack from Amazon that I purchased with the purpose of seeing what pockets/features I needed. Fortuitously, on the last trip of my week off, I bumped into a friend on the bank who had a rather good bag/backpack. It was a Korum Transition Ruckall. I decided to get one and then hit the current problem of seeing “out of stock” everywhere that I tried. I ended up ordering from eBay and it arrived soon after. I really like it. It is more of a blocky shape than a traditional rucksack (a bit like a small suitcase). However it is well equipped with large side pockets and a very large main area. Korum sell “Transition” pouches and tackle boxes designed to fit well. I ordered a few pouches but continued with my existing tackle box as it fit well. It has some clips for attaching a Korum chair but mine is not Korum so does not fit. This was easily overcome by purchasing some webbing and a range of clips from the internet and making up my own chair clips that work rather well. It is very comfortable to carry. The main problem is the temptation to fill it with all of your feeders, leads etc but it then becomes too heavy. The best thing I like is that it is designed to lay flat next to your seat so will not slip down the bank and provides a useful working area/table next to your chair.</p>
<p><strong>Trotting</strong><br>I had intented to have a day trotting during my week off but the heavy rains destroyed that idea. So, I headed off to the Cricket Field stretch one evening (peg 6) in the hope of catching plenty of small fish and perhaps a few bonus Roach and maybe even a Chub or two. I did manage several small Dace and Roach but I was plagued by Pike. They were chasing the hooked fish causing me to pull them out quickly and they also attacked my keepnet twice (causing damage). No large Roach or Chub turned up and I did not get any bites on the ledger that I left out with large baits. To be honest, I did not enjoy this session as I felt like I was just a feeding station for the Pike.</p>
<p><strong>Bream - attempt 2</strong><br>I then had a session at Ellenthorpe far lane. This is close to where the Swale branches off from the Ure. There are reputed to be some large Bream in that area so I put in plenty of groundbait and put out two rods alternating between Sweetcorn, Worm and Caster. Not a sniff! I managed a few smaller fish (Perch and Roach) but nothing that required the landing net.</p>
<p><strong>Pike again - arghhhh</strong><br>I had an evening at the Cricket Field stretch (peg 5) in the hope of locating more Chub and Barbel. It was extremely quiet until about one hour before dark. I got a bite on luncheon meat and expected it to be a decent Chub. However, after a brief fight my hook length snapped. I put on another hook and cast back into the same place with another piece of luncheon meat. It had been in less than a minute when my tip shot round again. A bloody Pike had taken my meat and I had hooked into the lip and managed to get it out. It was only small, perhaps 3lb. This made me think that my first fish had been a Pike and that’s why the hook length snapped.</p>
<p>I did manage three Chub but they were all in the 2 to 2.5lb bracket. The last one suddenly got very heavy as a very large Pike grabbed it. I managed to net the Pike and estimate it being close to a double. I am still not keen on photographing Pike, especially ones that are caught by mistake. Maybe I will have a Piking session one day but I don’t really like them.</p>
<p><strong>One last try</strong><br>There had been a team match on the Ellenthorpe stretch last weekend and a few Barbel had been caught as well as a 6lb Chub and a 4lb Bream. Before I divert my attention to Ellenthorpe I fancied one last try in my favourite peg 14. I fished my usual Chub rod near the downstream bush and my Barbel rod mid-river with Halibut pellet on the hook and a PVA mash bag of free offerings. I did not get a single bite near the bush - I can’t believe as this was a “banker” just a few weeks ago. </p>
<p>Thankfully I got one bite on the Barbel rod and it resulted in this 7lb 4oz Barbel. </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-09-18/7lb4ozBarbel.jpg" alt="7lb 4oz Barbel"></p>
<p>It’s been nearly three weeks since my last Barbel. I really hope that I can locate them again at Ellenthorpe. With Autumn approaching and the river being slower and deeper there, I also hope to get some good fish on the float. </p>
<p>The seasons turn and the river changes it’s character - I look forward to the next chapter on my local river Ure.</p>

        <p><strong>Average session with a cherry on top</strong><br>The river had been near normal for the last couple of days and it had been a mild and bright day. So my attention turned once again to Perch fishing at the Corn Dryer part of the Ellenthorpe stretch. </p>
<p>I fished my Barbel rod mid river with a hair rigged Halibut pellet for bait and a PVA mesh bag full of free offerings. I did not see any sign of Barbel but did get a long slow pull on the tip that resulted in a foul-hooked Pike that I netted. This was only a fish of about 3-4 pounds.</p>
<p>Most of my concentration was on the Perch line that was fished about 1/4 of the way across the river in the slow, shallow area where Perch are known to hunt. I fished with Lobworm in the hope of getting a large Perch or even a Chub. As it turns out, bites were much more sporadic than I expected. I ended up with half a dozen small-average Perch a three 6-8oz Roach.</p>
<p>I had kept the Perch and Roach in a keepnet but they started getting restless as the light level diminished. I was wary of a Pike attacking my net so decided to release the fish before that happened.</p>
<p>Just as I resettled into my chair, my tip started to rattle and I struck into my personal best Perch of 2lb 8oz. I have never had a Perch over 2lb so this brought a big smile. It’s a shame I didn’t frame myself correctly in the photo but at least the Perch looks proud: -</p>
