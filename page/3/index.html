        <p><strong>A different approach to loose feeding</strong><br>This evening I took my bait dropper having loose fed on recent trips. I was able to sneak up quite close to the downstream bush on peg 5 and put in 5 droppers of mixed hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, micro luncheon meat cubes and micro cheese cubes. I also put in the same about 1/3rd across the river just downstream of me. My plan was to fish the Barbel rod toward the bush and my Chub rod in mid river.</p>
<p><strong>Pesky Pike</strong><br>I tried a bit of cheese paste near the bush but got no interest. I then decided to put on big piece of meat and wait it out. This is where most of my Barbel have come from recently so I would alternate baits on the other rod and just leave the Barbel rod for the big boys! After about 20 minutes I got a few taps on the Barbel rod. Eventually this turned into a proper bite. I initially thought it was a Chub but I had managed to hook another Pike on meat. This time it was only a small one - maybe 3 pounds. I returned it and out went the meat again.</p>
<p><strong>Cheese paste strikes again</strong><br>I had been alternating baits on my Chub rod that was in mid river. I had a few very lite taps on lobworm but didn’t amount to anything. I eventually got a decent bite and was surprised to find that a Roach of about 8oz had snapped it up. I decided to put out my keepnet in the hope of at lease one Chub - I hadn’t any on my previous two trips!</p>
<p><strong>Cat and Mouse</strong><br>Just before 8pm I started getting knocks on the meat on my Barbel rod. It twitched a few times and then settled again. After the 3rd time I decided to twitch back and move the meat a foot or so. That did the trick and the tip shot round. I was into a Barbel that tore off downstream. This was a very fit fish and took lots of line before I was able to turn it and start to take back some line. I was pleased to be playing this fish on my stronger Barbel rod and 10lb line rather then the softer Chub rod with 8lb line that had caught several recent Barbel. That said, I was still struggling to exert dominance over this fish - especially when it broke surface and did its customary 2nd and 3rd wind lunges. I was delighted to finally net this glorious 8lb 10oz Barbel: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-08-02/8lb10ozBarbel.jpg" alt="8lb 10oz Barbel"></p>
<p>Once I calmed down, I decided to put in several more bait droppers of loose feed because I suspected that the Barbel had disturbed the swim so I was unlikely to scare any fish with the bait dropper. It was also time to put on my sweater as the sun was now very low and it was getting cooler. I took this opportunity to have a snack before starting to fish again.</p>
<p><strong>How long before the swim settles down</strong><br>Most of my recent trips have resulted in only one or two fish. I really wasn’t sure how long a swim took to recover. I was also starting to wonder if the Chub had moved downstream - something which they tend to do as the season progresses apparently.</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes I saw large ripples from the undercut bank between me and the downstream bush. As I peeked over, a stream of bubbles steaked right across my peg and a bloody Otter surfaced near the upstream bush just to my left. I shouted at it and clapped my hands and it duly disappeared. I suspected that this would further hinder the swims recovery.</p>
<p>However, no sooner had I sat down again when both rods started to get knocks. They were now both on luncheon meat so it looks like a swim takes about 15 minutes to recover - not bad.</p>
<p><strong>At last, an old friend</strong><br>About 15 minutes later my Barbel rod started to twitch and then bent around. I hooked into something that was fast but not very strong. I was hoping it was not another small Pike. It turned out to be a Chub of around 2lb. It was great to get a Chub again even though it wasn’t a whopper and was caught on the Barbel rod.</p>
<p><strong>Mid river doubts</strong><br>All of my previous fish from this peg have come from near the downstream bush except for the Roach that I caught earlier. When the river had been up and coloured, I was getting plenty of half bites mid river but nothing positive. I was starting to wonder if Chub and Barbel avoided that area. Just then I got a bite mid river and hit into something that I suspect was a small Chub - unfortunately it got off before I got it to the surface so I will never know.</p>
<p>I had managed to fish until 10pm on my previous visits but the nights are starting to draw in so I decided to fish until 9:30 tonight. It hadn’t been a bad session so would not mind going home earlier. It was 9:30 and I was just about to bring in my Barbel rod when something started twitching at the bait. I left it a moment and then tried twitching back - it had worked earlier. This time - no joy. I decided to leave that rod there whilst I packed up the Chub rod. Just as I leant forward to pick up the Chub rod, the tip bent around. I struck into a good fighing fish. Not a Barbel but I was hopeful of a decent Chub. I was rewarded by this chunky 4lb 9oz Chub: -</p>

<p>So, the Chub are still around. I had really enjoyed this session. Here are the three fish that I kept in the keepnet: -</p>

        <p><strong>River condition - excellent</strong><br>Following rain in recent days, the river had risen about 18 inches since I fished it two days ago. It was flowing quicker and also had some colour. I decided to fish the same peg 5 and the level now was perfect for this peg - the water was about 8 inches below the peg plateau. I had actually dropped my baiting needle on my previous visit and was hoping that it was still in the peg - hey presto, it was so that was a good start.</p>
<p>I immediately put out some loose feed and took my time setting everthing up. This would give any resident fish time to feed with confidence. Also, recent sessions had been very quiet until the last hour of daylight so didn’t think there was any need to rush.</p>
<p><strong>Activity from the off</strong><br>In stark contrast to the quiet starts of recent sessions, I was immediately getting good knocks on both rods. One was slightly downstream but out in/near the main flow and one was near the downstream bush. I decided to try sweetcorn for the first time on the Ure. </p>
<p><strong>That’s a first</strong><br>With the rod that was out in the main flow, I was just getting to grips with the right amount of lead. The flow was stronger so needed to experiment a bit. On the 3rd cast I got what I thought was a pluck on the bait but it could have been the lead resettling in the flow. After a few more minutes I reeled back in just in the case the bait had gone. To my surprise, my cube of meat had a definite bite out of it - must have been a Chub - just look how close it was to hooking itself: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-28/BiteOnMeat.jpg" alt="A bite - literally"></p>
<p><strong>Exciting - but frustrating</strong><br>I continued to get half-bites on both rods. I tried all of my baits just in case they would bite more positively on one particular bait. This made no difference - all baits, on both rods, kept getting bites that were not quite hittable. I was really enjoying it, I did not know which rod to concentrate on and felt on the verge of a good fish at any moment. I was pleased to be getting bites on sweetcorn and also on cheese paste mid-river, I had only fished it close to overhanging bushes before. There is no doubt that extra flow and colour turned on the fish - I just wish I could get my first fish.</p>
<p><strong>Here goes</strong><br>I decided to put a large cube of meat on both rods and just wait it out. Surely a positive bite would come eventually. At about 7:30, my rod bent over and I was into another fine Ure Barbel. This one fought really well in the stronger flow. I got it to the surface several times and each time off it went again. I was finally able to net this new personal best for the Ure at 10lb 11oz. My all time personal best is 11lb from the Swale - so close!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-28/10lb11ozBarbel.jpg" alt="10lb 11oz Barbel"></p>
<p>It felt great to get one in proper daylight and I was hopeful of more as the evening wore on. I baited up again and left the swim to recover for 20 minutes or so whilst I had some food/drink and recounted the battle and fish that had made this another memorable session.</p>
<p>The commotion caused by this fish clearly disturbed the swim. I struggled to get any more bites for a long time. As dusk approached I got a couple of half bites again but none of them delivered a fish.</p>
<p>Whilst packing up I heard a fish leap just downstream of me and out of view. A few minutes later a fish leapt in front of me. I think it was a Salmon and was probably the same fish.</p>

        <p>I don’t generally set targets for pleasure fishing but, having moved to Boroughbridge for the fishing, it seems only right that I set myself some objectives. That will encourage me to experiment with baits (e.g. cheese paste, slugs etc) and techniques (e.g. roving, touch ledgering etc). Also, some sessions may be quite short with little tackle but aimed directly at a specific target.</p>
<p>Some of these targets may take years to achieve but it will be interesting to be able to look back on my journey.</p>

        <p>I decided to try a different peg tonight. I chose peg 5 for the following reasons: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Less of a walk to get there</li>
<li>Large flat area to sit and lay out all of my gear</li>
<li>Not too far above the low-level of the river</li>
<li>It has an overhanging bush/tree on both sides of the peg</li>
<li>The depth seemed reasonable near the overhanging bushes - some pegs currently have just a few inches of depth close in</li>
</ul>
<p>My plan was to fish a large piece of luncheon meat near the upstream bush and vary my baits between lobworm, bread flake, cheese paste and luncheon meat near the downstream bush. I also decided to use a very light link (just 1 swan shot) near the downstream bush so that I could try touch ledgering near the bush and also allow the current to pull the bait very near or under the bush.</p>
<p>All sounds great in theory but, in practice, I was getting nothing other than tiny knocks on the cheese paste and bread flake. I guess that meant small fish. After a while I decided to put luncheon meat on both rods, place them in a their rests and just wait.</p>
<p>I was just starting to contemplate a blank session (thankfully not getting too many of them recently) when my downstream rod bent right round. I hit into a Barbel that took me a long way downstream. My line was right under the bush so I was not hopeful of getting this fish out. After letting it run for a while I tightened my drag slightly and managed to turn the fish. Eventually it moved out into mid river and I heaved a sigh of relief as it cleared the downstream bush. Then, after rolling on the surface, it made a lunge for the upstream bush and I saw the branches moving - not a good sign. Fortuitiously it untangled itself and swam back out into mid river. Finally I slid the net under this 8lb 8oz Barbel that was in perfect condition. If you look carefully at the anal fin, you can see a trace of what I believe was milt so perhaps the Barbel are still spawning - albeit a little late for that.</p>

<p>That was the only bite of the session. Still, I had now got to know another peg and had a lovely Barbel to boot. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Setting the scene</strong><br>Today was forecast to be mainly overcast but dry. However it quickly became apparent that there was a lot of blue sky around. I checked the forecast again about 9am (having arrived about 7am) and it had changed to be mainly sunny - oh dear, a low, clear river with sun - not a good combination. Oh well, there are worse ways to spend a day.</p>
<p>I decided to fish a new peg today. It’s the next proper peg along from peg 14. I think this is known as the “Barrel peg”. There was an overhanging bush/tree on my left (upstream) and a large area of slack from there to as far as I could see along the nearside bank. There was also a large tree downstream of me but, due to low water levels, was too far above the water and the water was clear and shallow below it so of no use. I think this will be a day to fish to the ample bush coverage on the far bank. I have not tried this yet but the slow flow should help me hold station near those bushes and, considering the sunlight, is probably where the fish will be.</p>
<p>So I began with a large chunk of luncheon meat straight in front of me and close to the farside coverage. I was using a block-end swim feeder with enlarged holes to help disperse my feed of hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets, micro luncheon meat cubes and micro cheese cubes. I was getting light knocks so there were definitely fish around although probably small stuff. Whilst it was still early, I decided to put my other rod into the main flow in case there were any Barbel patrolling but, to be honest, the light levels were not helping.</p>
<p><strong>First bite - a surprise!</strong><br>It wasn’t too long before my farside rod get a proper bite. Not a rod-bending bite more like something had picked up my bait but was still moving along the bottom - no bolting. I struck into a solid fish that came toward me relatively easily. Not like a Barbel unless it had not woken up yet. As it got closer it then started on some hard lunges, again not like a Barbel but strong all the same. It certainly tested out my drag setting. After several lunges I got it to the surface and, low and behold, it was a decent Pike. I expected to see a Chub hanging from it’s mouth but it quickly became apparent that it was hooked normally. I netted it and, sure enough, it had taken my lunchoen meat and was hooked inside the mouth. I was very lucky that it’s teeth had not cut my line. I estimated it to be about 10lb as it was similar in length and girth to the 10lb Barbel I caught 3 days ago. </p>
<p>I had setup my camera but, whilst trying to find a safe way to held it (they were big teeth!), the Pike flipped out of my hands and managed to get back in the river. Oh well, at least this was hooked and landed normally so I can count this as a fair catch - unlike the others that have grabbed my Chub recently. The other plus was that I had probably removed it from the farside swim which I had been baiting up. </p>
<p><strong>Nice looking but not welcome</strong><br>Just as I was settling down after the Pike, I saw lots of streams of bubbles in front of me and then heard something surface under the bush on my left hand side. I had been loose feeding near that bush so did welcome the appearance of an Otter! After a moment or so I then saw the stream of bubbles heading to mid river from near the bush. There was more than one stream of bubbles and it wasn’t long before two Otters surfaced, mid-river, right in front of me and watched me. One of then surfaced clutching a small fish. I quickly retrieved my feeder rod and made a heavy cast/splash near them in the hope of spooking them and getting them to move elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Time for a change</strong><br>As the sun got higher and the day heated up, I was not getting any interest mid river. I decided to try near the upstream bush on my nearside bank. When retrieving my lead/bait from there I realised it was quite shallow. The water was moving near there so I assumed it was a bit deeper but, donning my polarised sun glasses, it was only a couple of feet deep. Perhaps not so good in clear water with sunny skies.</p>
<p>I then decided to fish both rods to the farside coverage. I kept one on lunchean meat and alternated the other between bread flake and cheese paste. I was getting small knocks but no real takes.</p>
<p>So, perhaps another change of bait. I put on a lobworm, cast to the farside coverage and sure enough, started to get reasonable knocks. Whilst I told myself to sit on my hands because Chub have a habit of nipping the ends of worms with their lips, I forgot my own advice and struck too early. So, out with another worm. This time I waited a bit longer but then seemed like the fish had taken it so I struck into the following Perch - a fish of 1lb 10oz: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-24/Perch.jpg" alt="1lb 10oz Perch"></p>
<p>I was pleased with this Perch. One of the biggest that I have caught for some time. So it looked like today may be the day of the predators.</p>
<p><strong>Long hard slog</strong><br>Despite alternating baits, the hot sunny weather and low-clear river combination was wearing me down. No bites. I did start to notice that the flow was picking up. Also, there was more rubbish coming down the river, catching in my farside lines. I could see that the level was also rising very slightly. After a while it became tricky to fish the farside due to the increased flow and the flotsam snagging in my lines. I decided on an ealier than normal finish today - 3:30pm would do it. That gave me about 40 minutes to go. I decided to finish by fishing worm near my upstream/nearside bush and worm to my right (downstream) but just this side of the main flow.</p>
<p><strong>Time to go - or is it?</strong><br>With about 15 minutes to go I pulled up my keepnet and let the Perch go. I decided to give the net 15 minutes to try out in the sun. No sooner had I done that and settled back down when the rod near the upstream bush burst into action. The result was this lovely 3lb 2oz Chub: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-24/Chub.jpg" alt="3lb 2oz Chub"></p>
<p>Typical, the main purpose of the keepnet it to prevent a returned Chub from spooking the swim (they are reknowned for doing that). Should I put the net back in or just give it another hour or so to see if I can catch another? I decided to put the Chub straight back and leave the net drying in the sun.</p>
<p>So, another hour. I decided to try 4-5 casters on my size 8 hook that was being fished downstream, just my side of the main flow. This technique caught me my 1st Barbel on the Ure so worth a try. No Barbel but I noticed that my tip never stopped tapping away. There are lots of small fish nipping at those casters.</p>
<p><strong>I wonder…</strong><br>I decided to go down to a lighter hook length with a size 14 hook and fish 2 casters. I wanted to see what was attacking my bait. I also swapped my ledger for a 2 swan-shot link. I still had 8lb main line so this would not be a fair fight but, should a bigger fish take the bait, I was still prepared. I also wanted to prove that I could still catch small fish in quick succession.</p>
<p>Dace - all the way down! Using the lighter setup I kept my rod in my hand because the Dace started to hit the casters as soon as they hit the water. They followed it all the way down to the river bed. My tip never stopped knocking. Hitting the bites was another matter but I did manage quite a few of varied sizes. This was enjoyable but, to be honest, I was hoping a larger fish would join the party but that’s maybe something for another day.</p>
<p><strong>Time to go again - or is it?</strong><br>My extra hour was almost passed and, right on cue, my worm was taken by another Chub. This was smaller at about 1.5lb. However it was most appreciated and meant that I now needed to fish an extra 30 minutes - just in case ;-)</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to call it a day. I had caught a 10lb Pike, 1lb 10oz Perch, 2 Chub and probably around 15-20 Dace. Considering the conditions I was quite happy with this but still long for a daytime session that produces more Chub and Barbel action. For now, evenings seem the best bet.</p>

        <p><strong>Be Prepared</strong><br>On my previous session I got snapped so vowed to swap to using 10lb line on my Barbel rod and move the 8lb line from the Barbel rod to my Chub rod that currently contained 6lb line. I ordered the 10lb line last night and it arrived this morning. Did I have time to move my line about between different reels to make room for the 10lb line before tonight’s session … what the hell, I will make time. What a good decision that was!</p>
<p>I started off fishing slugs near the overhanging tree but never got any serious takes, just lots of tiny knocks. In fact, that set the tone for the evening. No matter what baits I tried (cheese paste, bread flake, luncheon meat, hot dog sausage, casters) all I was getting were tiny knocks from small fish.</p>
<p>As the evening wore on I decided to concentrate on large pieces of luncheon meat. Again I could see it being pestered by small fish but I knew that the meat would survive the attention of the small fish.</p>
<p>Eventually, about 9pm, I got my first proper bite - the tip swung around and I connected to a steam train! The fish took off downstream and I had to keep tension and prevent it from reaching far side trees. This was on the 8lb line which had been the 6lb line only 2 days before - phew! I was able to withstand it’s lunges and eventually started to retrieve some of my line and slowly work the fish toward me. When it broke the surface I was staggered by its size. As usual this was followed by another strong lunge, I am glad I had my drag set properly! As the fish got within netting range I had to bring it over the top of some weed. It saw its opportunity and once again powered down into the weed. I appeared to be stuck fast and feared I had lost the fish. However, releasing a bit of tension allowed the fish to start to move. This process was repeated about 3 time before I was finally able to slip the net under this stunning 10lb 4oz Barbel - I am really glad I brought my extra long landing net handle as I was quite a bit above the river level.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-21/10lb4ozBarbel.jpg" alt="10lb 4oz Barbel"></p>
<p>So, that’s one bite and one fish but what a cracker. I am sure that it would have beaten me on the 6lb line so thank heavens that I took the time to prepare properly.</p>
<p>After about another 30 minutes the same rod tip bent around again. This also felt like a good fish but did not tear off into mid river, instead it headed for the tree and other bankside vegetation. That can only mean one thing - Chub! Whilst it gave a good account of itself initially, it was soon spent and I then slipped my net under this superb 5lb 2oz Chub! </p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-21/5lb2ozChub.jpg" alt="5lb 2oz Chub"></p>
<p>Only 2 sessions ago I had met my previous target of 10 Chub in my first season on the Ure so I set myself a new target of a 5lb Chub. Several of the guys in the club remarked that this target would probably be met by a fat winter Chub. The Ure once again came up trumps. I was going to set myself a target of a double figure Barbel but I also met that today. I will have to have a think about my next target.</p>
<p>FYI: Here is my <a href="/2020/07/20200726-Fishing-Targets/">target diary</a></p>
<p>So, 2 bites and 2 incredible fish. It just goes to show that fishing can suddenly turn a blank into a session to remember. This was a magic 45 minutes. I was smiling to myself most of the way back to the car and look forward to my next visit. </p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Following on from my roving session, I decided to add another rod (no rod bag) and baits in a zipped up groundbait bowl/bag. I decided to take my usual loosefeed mix tonight and go back to my favourite peg 14 for the evening. I also managed to put my landing net pole into my rucksack so had only 2 rods in one hand and my groundbait bag in the other. Again this was a very light load and walking to the river was a breeze.</p>
<p>I used my 2 swan shot link ledger with cheese paste near the tree and my Barbel rod with a 3/4oz lead just this side of the main flow. I would stick to luncheon meat on the Barbel rod.</p>
<p>My cheese paste had been in about 10 minutes when I got my best wrap-around bite yet. The Chub took me into the tree and fought hard. Several times I had to ease the pressure to let it swim free before I was finally able to pull it clear of the tree. By then it was spent and came to the net quite easily. Here is the result: -</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020-07-19/SMT_20200719.jpg" alt="A quick Chub"></p>
<p>It dawned on me that I had not brought my keepnet so would be releasing the Chub into my swim (generally a bad idea with Chub). It was quite a walk down to another accessible swim so didn’t fancy releasing it elsewhere - would just have to take my chances.</p>
<p>Now that I had ascertained that Chub were about, it was time to try the slugs. I have never used them before so here goes. Unfortunately, I cast the 1st one straight into the tree - doh! Whilst I got all me gear back, the slug did drop off. I only had 3 so it was time to try another having loose fed (unintentionally) with the previous one. I was getting plucks straight away and was looking forward to another Chub fairly quickly. Unfortunately none of the plucks turned into proper bites (on either of the remaining slugs). Still, worth a try on another day. I might try them before anything else to prevent spooking any bigger/wiser fish that may be around.</p>
<p>So, back to alternating bread flake and cheese paste. As previously the bread flake seemed to receive a lot of attention from small fish - no positive bites. </p>
<p>Eventually, as the evening drew to a close, I decided to try luncheon meat near the tree. I got a few knocks quite quickly but no positive bites. I then decided on a much bigger piece of meat and quickly got a bite that I was certain to hit - but there was nothing there when I struck. So, one with another big piece of meat. After a few minutes this pulled the tip right around and I struck into a very strong fish. It immediately took line and I am sure went under and beyond the tree. I am not sure if it was a big Chub on its first lunge or a Barbel because my 6lb line snapped.</p>
<p>I did not get any bites on my Barbel rod/ 8lb line. However I have decided that I am going to use 8lb line (instead of 6lb) on my Chub rod and step up to 10lb on the Barbel rod. It seems that I have to fish close to snags so need equipment that allows me to get the fish away from the snags asap.</p>
<p>On the way back to the car I found another couple of slugs so look forward to my next trip!</p>

        <p><strong>Diving again at last</strong><br>Today a few us were finally released from lock-down and able to dive at the Capernwary dive site. This is a quarry near Carnforth close to the Lake District. It is setup for diving and has several underwater attractions including sunken boats, light airfcraft, a passenger airliner, helicopters nice sized Roach, Perch, some sizeable Trout and some ever growing Sturgeon (largest about 6 feet long at the time of writing).</p>
<p>I must congratulate Capernwray on their efforts to re-open safely for diving once the lockdown measures were eased. They control the number of visitors per day, have re-organised the cafe and shop to provide social distancing and one-way routes and they have provided plenty of wipes and hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>It was drizzling on arrival and got heavier as we started to kit up. This was a shame as we left home in bright sunshine. It had been a while since we all dived so took a bit longer to get kitted up.</p>
<p>We had one dive in the morning and I was presently suprised by the visibility, particularly at the western side of the quarry. This was followed by a nice lunch we we had to eat outside due to a ban on indoor eating. Thankfully the rain had ceased so lunch was quite pleasant. We then had an afternoon dive where Nigel and I ended up diving around the entire perimiter of the quarry - quite a swim! </p>
<p>We finished with a cuppa and a chat - such simple delights but oh how I have missed this kind of thing. </p>
<p>I decided not to take my stills camera so that I could just enjoy the diving. I did, however, take my Go Pro and shot the following, the juvenile Sturgeon appears about 5:03 into the video.</p>

        <p><strong>No fish but a few things learned</strong></p>
<p>Having caught a few fish, I was starting to get a feel for how and where feeding fish could be found. It was therefore time to dispense with carrying everything that I might ever need so that I could adopt a mobile/roving approach.</p>
<p>Recently cheese paste and breadfake seemed to get bites fairly quickly when presented close to an overhanging bush/tree. Therefore I decided to stick to alternating between these baits although I did take some luncheon meat for backup. I did not take any of my usual loosefeed (hemp, caster, micro halibut pellets and micro cubes of meat).</p>
<p>I setup one rod with a 2 swan shot link ledger and one of my size 8 hooks with expanding foam glued to the shank.</p>
<p>I started in peg 2 but first put a few loose offerings near the tree in peg 3. I spent aboyut 40 minutes in peg 2 and had a few tentative plucks at my chesse paste/breadflake baits but nothing positive. </p>
<p>I then moved onto peg 3 but first put a few loose offerings near the bush in peg 4. Another 40 minutes or so with no interest meant it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Again I pre-baited peg 5 before having a go in peg 4. Again, nothing that I could strike at. I think that small fish were attacking the breadflake.</p>
<p>By the time I got to peg 5 I decided to remain there and settled into a snack/drink. There was a nice raft of flotsam near the tree so was very inviting to fish under. I got a few more postive bites but failed to hit the first few. By now I was flicking my bait beyond the tree, into the main flow, then holding it back so that it swung around under the tree before letting it settle. Eventually I got a proper bite just as the bait settled on the bottom - I hadn’t even put the rod on the rest. It shot out into mid river and after several hard fought minutes I realised that I had hooked a small Chub that had once again been taken by a large Pike. This time the Pike won and eventually snapped my line.</p>
<p>I did not get any other bites but that’s not suprising if there were large Pike around. I had also seen an Otter patrolling the far bank which probably didn’t help either.</p>
<p>So, no fish but I developed a way to get my bait under a tree without having to cast dangerously close to the tree. I also modified my kit/load even more by putting my landing net in my folder chair meaning that I only had to carry my rod and landing net pole - everything else attached to my ruck sack. This was very comfortable and allowed me to walk with ease. A final couple of bonuses is that, whilst walking back in near darkness, I saw a family of Deer playing on the river bank. I also saw several big black slugs on my way back so decided to collect a few with some leaves so that I could try them on my next visit.</p>
